# Changelog

All notable changes to `cgg` are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project is
pre-1.0, so the resolver's edge set may grow between releases (it only
ever grows in default mode — see *Compatibility* below).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The Rust cross-file resolver emitted guessed edges at sites it had
  already bound, into helpers it could not reach, and by bare name where
  the receiver was known.** Measured on cgg's own tree: 1,976 of 5,449
  edges were `cross-file:imports / medium`; 299 landed on a site the
  intra-file pass had already resolved (the dedupe key included the
  destination, so a fan-out to *other* destinations passed), 550 pointed
  into another file's private `mod tests` helper, 212 came from calls
  inside macro token trees whose receiver had been dropped, and 405 came
  from a lowercase path-headed receiver (`super::dynuse::extract`,
  `serde_json::from_str`) treated as a variable and fanned out. Every
  class was found by reading the audit sidecar and confirmed against the
  source before anything was changed.

  Ten resolver changes, each with a unit test that fails on 0.8.3:
  cross-file skips a site intra-file already bound, keyed
  `(src, site_byte, name)` so chained calls at one byte survive; fan-out
  candidates are filtered by `Vis::Private` and by a `::tests::` module
  the caller does not import, with the fan-out cap judged *before* the
  filter so a filter can only shrink an edge set; macro-argument calls
  keep their receiver (`p.id()`, `NodeIds::resolve(..)`,
  `TrustKind::Network.f()`), drop turbofish, retry bare only on a
  crate-wide unique name, and bind through by-name fan-out only when a
  single candidate survives (an impl preferred over its trait's own
  declaration); `use crate::x::y;` and `pub use` chains have their
  leading `crate`/`self`/`super` rewritten so they match the callable
  index; a `::`-path receiver rewrites `crate`/`super`/`self` from the
  caller, tries every prefix as an owner (enum-variant receivers,
  builder chains), and matches an external-crate head only by full
  path; `owner_from_qn` no longer files `<A as TryFrom<B>>::try_from`
  under `B`; `<StdType as Trait>::m` impls are not indexed under the
  bare std owner unless the workspace declares a type of that name;
  let-type inference sees through `Arc/Rc/Box/RefCell/Cell/Mutex/RwLock/
  Pin/Cow` and `.clone()`; FFI pass B requires the language family and
  owner to match; integration-test files are qualified
  `<crate>::tests::<file>` instead of colliding on the crate root.

- **Value references were logged as `ambiguous-in-file` calls.** 940 of
  the 972 such entries on cgg's own tree were bare identifier arguments.
  They now carry `value-ref-ambiguous` / `value-ref-no-enclosing`; the
  dead-code roots and evidence passes accept both alongside the old
  reasons, so a function passed as a value at module scope keeps its
  `toplevel:invocation` root (flask: 1,024 roots, 113 findings, identical
  to 0.8.3). A `Via::Reference` edge is emitted for any target except a
  closure bound to the same name.

### Added

- **`SkipReason::Minified`.** The walker skips `.min.{js,mjs,cjs,css}`
  and any file averaging more than 2,000 bytes per line, with an audit
  row and a summary count. `workbook_still_waters`: 1,005 -> 81 ms; four
  vendored bundles held 4,490 callables.
- **The auto `--jobs` cap rises to 32 once a host has 32 physical cores**
  (was fixed at 8). Graph byte-identical at any job count.

### Compatibility

**The default graph shrinks, deliberately.** This departs from the
standing rule that the default edge set only ever grows. On cgg's own
tree the change removes 765 unique edges and adds 79; by call-site byte
the removals break down as 550 into another file's private `mod tests`
helper, 188 at sites that keep a surviving edge (a fan-out narrowed to
one target), 14 FFI edges from a Python stub into the Node binding, and
20 sites left with no edge, every one read by an independent reader
(3 were real calls). On `llmitm-v5`: 2,191 removed (1,040 narrowed, 446
external-head or std-impl, 268 tests-helper, 426 sites left dark: of
357 read individually 25 were real calls, the rest are the
macro-argument width rule, roughly 36 real by the sampled rate), 874
added. Two audit `UnresolvedReason` variants are new, so a 0.8.3 binary
refuses `--from-graph` on a graph this version writes
(`unknown variant value-ref-ambiguous`); it fails loudly, not wrongly.

Not covered, and still wrong: a single-segment external receiver
(`serde_json::from_str(..)` arrives as receiver `serde_json`,
indistinguishable from a local variable) still produces 64 false edges
on cgg's tree.

### Performance

`scripts/compare-release.py`, 0.8.3 release binary against this change,
110 corpus repositories, timing the minimum of two alternating runs
with eight repos measured concurrently:

| | 0.8.3 | this change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| corpus total | 160.3s | 93.9s (**-41.4%**) |
| edges | 2,623,507 | 2,386,150 (**-9.0%**) |
| unresolved sites | 4,518,823 | 4,141,367 (**-8.4%**) |
| repos gaining edges | — | 0 of 110 |
| 87 repos with identical callables: edges | 1,299,845 | 1,217,505 (**-6.3%**) |
| same 87: wall | 72.1s | 50.9s (**-29.4%**) |

The wall-clock delta belongs to the walker skip and the job cap; the
resolver changes are wall-neutral (cgg's own tree 119 -> 104 ms with
the cap). Repos under 150 ms are noise by this script's own note.
`determinism-sweep.py`: 25 repos x 3 runs, 0 nondeterministic.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **`--rollup` and every large tree got dramatically faster: two
  accidental quadratics removed from type propagation.** Strategy 4 of
  the receiver-type propagator asks, per receiver, "which functions
  return a type named like this receiver, and is one of them called
  earlier in this file". It answered both halves by brute force. For the
  first it walked the **corpus-wide** `return_types` map once per
  receiver, allocating a `to_lowercase()` and a `format!()` per entry.
  For the second it scanned every reference in the file, once per
  surviving candidate.

  On `erlang-otp` that measured **817,607,605 map iterations** and
  **1,864,725,063 reference-scan steps**, costing 60.2s of a 91s run —
  66% of wall.

  Both inputs are loop-invariant. The lowercasing depends only on the
  map, so `ReturnTypeIndex` hoists it to once per run. The "called
  earlier" predicate only ever needs the *earliest* bare call per name,
  so it is answered by scanning for the first few lookups and by a
  per-file map after that — whichever is cheaper for the file in hand.

  **`erlang-otp`: 19,819 -> 10,834 ms (-45.3%)**, median of 9 alternated
  pairs on an idle host, and 95,851 -> 33,857 ms (**-64.7%**) at
  `--jobs 1`.

  The variance matters more than the median. 0.8.2's nine runs of that
  repo ranged **19,116-36,222 ms** — a 90% spread on identical input.
  0.8.3's range is 10,271-11,120 ms, an 8% spread. The quadratic's cost
  scaled with allocator and scheduling pressure, so removing it removed
  the unpredictability too. That is why this one repository has poisoned
  every corpus perf sweep it appeared in: the +38.6% attributed to it
  during the 0.8.2 measurements was this variance, not a real delta.

- **`--profile` works on release builds; the README said it did not.**
  `profile.rs` moved from `#[cfg]`-compiling spans out of release to a
  runtime flag, for the reason its own doc comment gives — a debug build
  distorts the ratios you are reading, and a pathological input is
  exactly when you need the truth. The flag table was never updated.
  This mattered: the investigation above depended on profiling a release
  build of a 177 MB tree, which the README described as impossible.

### Added

- **`profile::count` — count-only tallies, reported beside the span
  table.** A span answers "how long"; a tally answers "how many", which
  is the question when the suspicion is an accidentally-quadratic loop.
  Time alone cannot distinguish one slow iteration from ten million fast
  ones, and that distinction was the whole diagnosis here. Same
  `ENABLED` gate as spans, so a run without `--profile` pays one relaxed
  atomic load and a predicted branch.

- Per-language instrumentation of the type propagator, behind
  `--profile`. The attribution is load-bearing rather than decorative:
  `erlang-otp` was assumed to be an Erlang problem, and the first
  measurement put 1.86 billion inner-scan steps in an unnamed catch-all
  bucket. Naming C and C++ showed **`cpp` alone accounts for 93% of
  them, from 171 vendored files**, while Erlang's 4,106 files and
  731,928 references contribute essentially none. The repository is slow
  because it vendors the BEAM VM's C++ sources.

### Compatibility

**No graph changes.** Verified against 0.8.2 across all 164 benchmark
repositories, none excluded: `-t json` byte-identical once timings are
normalised, `-t mermaid` byte-identical, and the ordered callable-id
list identical element-wise. Order was checked as strictly as identity
because 0.8.2 numbers mermaid ids by graph position, so a reordering
that preserved both sets would still rewrite every id and every arrow.

Per-language totals were compared separately, because "no repo changed"
is not the same claim as "no language changed": **47 languages
exercised, 0 changed** — files, callables and edges identical for every
one.

The comparison normalises `cgg_version` out of the JSON document. It
embeds the version, so a released binary and a bumped one differ on
every repo for a reason that has nothing to do with the graph — and an
earlier run of this check passed only because it compared 0.8.2 against
an unreleased branch still calling itself 0.8.2. Mermaid carries no
version string, which is what exposed it.

### Performance

Paired and alternated, median of 3 runs per repo at `--jobs 16`, 164
repos, against the 0.8.2 release binary:

| | 0.8.2 | 0.8.3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| corpus total | 294.8s | 266.2s (**-9.7%**) |
| median per-repo | — | **-4.3%** |
| repos >5% faster | — | 60 |

Largest wins: `aws-lambda-go` -71.1%, `go-fzf` -67.0%,
`csharp-mediatr` -63.5%, `erlang-otp` -43.2%, `c-redis` -29.2%.

**On regressions, and on a measurement mistake worth recording.** An
earlier revision of this change built the per-file map unconditionally,
which charged an O(references) pass to every file in every language to
fix a cost only some of them pay. That is the failure mode this entry
exists to avoid, and it was caught by per-repo timing rather than by the
total — which read a healthy -8.9% throughout.

The regression list it produced was itself misleading. Filtered at a
150 ms floor it named 15 repos; **14 of those had sub-second baselines
and are not measurable on this host**, where identical runs of the same
two commits gave `fsharp-paket` +49.4% and then -34.3%. Timing here is
now reported only for repos with a baseline of **1 second or more**, and
a regression is not treated as real unless it reproduces across runs. By
that standard no reproducible regression was found at any point.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **`--node-ids short|hash`, and mermaid now numbers its nodes by
  default.** A mermaid node id is written once in the node's declaration
  and again on both ends of every edge that touches it — on cgg's own
  tree, 2,232 nodes against 3,792 edge pairs — and it was a
  ten-character base36 content hash. That is the worst possible string
  for a BPE tokenizer to carry three times per node, and the primary
  consumer of this format is a coding agent reading it in a context
  window, where those tokens are the whole budget.

  Nodes are now numbered `N0`, `N1`, … in graph order. Across the
  164-repo benchmark corpus that takes the mermaid output from
  **217,119,809 to 172,590,073 bytes — 20.5% smaller** (24.1% on cgg's
  own tree, which is denser in `::`-qualified names than the corpus
  average). The token saving is larger than the byte saving, because
  `N7` is one token where `Cu7kwiat260` is several. `--node-ids hash`
  restores the previous output, which is what you want to diff two
  revisions' diagrams or line one up against `-t json`. Only mermaid's
  default changed; dot and graphml still hash unless asked, and `-t json`
  cannot be renumbered at all — its ids are the identity `--from-graph`
  reads back — so asking there prints a warning rather than quietly
  doing nothing.

  **Verified corpus-wide that no node or edge moved.** Over all 164
  repositories, none excluded: `-t json` from the old and new binaries is
  identical once per-run timings are normalised — every callable, edge,
  id, confidence and resolver provenance — and `--node-ids hash` is
  byte-identical to the old default output. The numbered rendering
  declares exactly the same nodes and draws exactly the same arrows as
  the hashed one: **2,148,745 nodes and 2,433,611 arrows checked, zero
  differences.**

  **The qualified name is deliberately not the id.** It looks like the
  obvious answer and is wrong twice over. Qualified names are not
  unique — 41 of cgg's own 2,232 callables share one with another
  callable, and corpus-wide 17.7% of callables share
  `(language, file, owner, qualified_name)` because C++, C#, Java and
  Erlang have overloads in quantity — so using the name as the id merges
  distinct functions and silently reroutes their edges. And it is
  *bigger*: a name repeated on every edge renders the same graph at
  379,524 bytes, 39% worse than the hash it would have replaced.
  Numbering is the only scheme that is both smaller and collision-free,
  and it is collision-free by construction.

  Reachable from all four front ends: `--node-ids` on the CLI,
  `node_ids=` on `cgg.analyze()` and `Graph.to_mermaid()` in Python,
  `nodeIds` in the Node options and `toMermaid("hash")`, and
  `"node_ids"` in the C ABI's options JSON — no new exported symbol,
  which is what passing options as a document is for.

- **A prebuilt `linux-aarch64` CLI binary.** Wheels have shipped for that
  target for several releases while the CLI did not, so `cargo install`
  — a from-source compile — was the only route on ARM Linux. That was a
  gap in the release matrix, not a limitation: the node job already
  cross-compiles the identical Rust and the identical 44 tree-sitter C
  grammars for `linux-arm64-gnu` on an x86 runner, and the CLI now uses
  the same toolchain and environment.

  Verified before it was added, on hardware rather than by symmetry:
  cross-built on x86_64 and executed on a real aarch64 machine, where
  its mermaid, dot and graphml output over the same tree is
  **byte-identical** to a natively-built binary, and the `--from-graph`
  and `--dead-code` paths both run. CI cannot make that check — an x86
  runner cannot execute an ARM binary, and its ARM smoke tests are
  skipped for exactly that reason — so the job asserts the weaker thing
  it can: that `readelf` reports AArch64, which catches a cross-build
  that silently produced an x86 binary under an ARM name.

### Fixed

- **`--rollup` measured its budget against the wrong renderer once the
  node-id scheme became selectable.** The budget is a claim about the
  *rendered* size, and the rendering is a third larger under
  `--node-ids hash` than under numbering. Measuring the numbered form
  while emitting the hashed one would have let a run sail past the budget
  it was given — silently, because the stderr line reports the figure it
  measured, not the document it wrote. The scheme is resolved once
  (`NodeIds::resolve`) and both the budget and the artifact read that one
  answer; a regression test picks a budget strictly between the two
  renderings of one graph and asserts the schemes disagree about whether
  it fits.

  Caught before release, so no shipped version is affected — the flag and
  the defect arrived in the same unreleased change.

- **`scripts/docs-check.py` check 8 read the wrong `#[pyo3(signature)]`.**
  It searched for the first one in `crates/cgg-py/src/lib.rs`, which was
  `fn analyze`'s only for as long as no other function had one. The first
  renderer to take a keyword argument shifted it, and the check reported
  all 28 of `analyze`'s keywords as missing. It is anchored on
  `fn analyze` now.

### Changed

- **crates.io is published by the release workflow, gated on every other
  registry succeeding first.** It was manual by design, and the design
  was half right: crates.io *is* the one channel where a mistake cannot
  be undone, because a version can never be re-uploaded — only yanked.
  But the answer to that is ordering, not a human. Every other channel is
  recoverable (PyPI takes `skip-existing`, npm can be re-run, a GitHub
  release can be recreated), so they now all prove themselves first and
  the irreversible act happens last, in a `crates` job with
  `needs: publish`. If wheels, npm or the release binaries fail, no crate
  is uploaded and the version number is still free.

  Requires a `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` repository secret. It keeps
  `environment: release`, so an approval gate can be put in front of it
  in repo settings.

  A `preflight` job checks all three publish credentials before anything
  is published. Without it a missing crates.io token surfaces at the very
  end — GitHub, PyPI and npm ship, then `crates` dies on auth and three
  of four registries sit at the new version. Checking inside `crates`
  would be correct and useless: by then the irreversible ordering has
  already released the recoverable channels.

  Three supporting changes in `scripts/publish-crates.sh`, which the job
  runs rather than reimplementing:

  - `--yes` skips the typed-version confirmation. CI has no tty; the
    prompt stays the default for humans, who can still change their mind.
  - **Resumable.** `already uploaded` now counts as success. Because the
    version is spent either way, a run that dies after three of six
    crates has to be *finishable* — previously a re-run failed on the
    first crate that had landed, leaving the workspace half-published
    with no way forward.
  - The last crate is verified on the index like every other. It was
    skipped because nothing depends on it, which is true for *ordering*
    and wrong for *verification*.

  Resumability creates a hole on its own — a tag whose manifest disagreed
  with it could report success while publishing nothing, since every
  crate would read as already uploaded. The job therefore asserts the tag
  matches `Cargo.toml` before it runs, and independently reads back all
  six crates from the registry afterwards.

### Compatibility

**Mermaid node ids changed shape, and this ships as a patch release.**
`cgg -t mermaid` now writes `N0`, `N1`, … where 0.8.1 wrote
`Cu7kwiat260`. Anything that parses cgg's mermaid ids — rather than its
labels — needs `--node-ids hash` to keep the old form. Nothing else
changed: dot, graphml and json are byte-identical to 0.8.1's, and the
hashed mermaid rendering is byte-identical too.

By this project's own versioning policy a new flag is a MINOR bump, and
a changed default output arguably more so. It ships as 0.8.2 by explicit
decision, on the grounds that the **graph** is provably untouched — see
the verification below — and only the rendering moved. Calling that out
here rather than letting a patch number imply nothing happened.

**Numbered ids make graph order observable, so order was verified too.**
A content hash is a pure function of a callable's identity: before this
release, if a parallel phase had ever emitted callables in a different
order, every id stayed put and the diagram was unchanged. An ordinal has
no such protection — a reorder would shift every id and every edge line
with it. `scripts/determinism-sweep.py` deliberately stopped varying
`--jobs`, and `tests/determinism.rs` covered thread counts only on a
small fixture, so this combination had no coverage on real input.

It does now, three ways. A new test,
`mermaid_is_byte_identical_at_every_thread_count`, pins the rendering at
`--jobs 1/2/3/8/32` with the hashed form as a control. Across the corpus,
**157 repositories were rendered at multiple worker counts and every one
was byte-identical** — 152 at `--jobs 1,2,8,32` and the five largest at
`--jobs 1,2,3,8,32,64`, none excluded. And the corpus A/B below settles
the root question: the JSON is byte-identical to 0.8.1's, and JSON
serialises callables in graph order, so the order these ordinals read is
the order 0.8.1 already shipped.

**The graph is unchanged, and that was checked rather than assumed.**
Across all 164 repositories of the benchmark corpus, none excluded:
`-t json` from 0.8.1 and 0.8.2 is identical once per-run timings are
normalised — every callable, edge, id, confidence level and resolver
provenance — and `--node-ids hash` output is byte-identical to 0.8.1's
default. The numbered rendering declares exactly the same nodes and
draws exactly the same arrows as the hashed one: **2,148,745 nodes and
2,433,611 arrows compared, zero differences.**

### Performance

**The project's own perf gate cannot measure this change, and saying so
is the honest headline.** `scripts/perf-compare.sh` benchmarks with
`-t json -o /dev/null` (`bench_one`). This release touches the *mermaid*
writer; the JSON path it times is byte-identical to 0.8.1's. So the table
below is a regression check on the shared pipeline — walk, parse,
resolve — and nothing in it can be an effect of the change.

Paired A/B, `146bb7b` (post-0.8.1) against this commit, both built on the
same 64-core host, median of 3 runs per repo at `--jobs 1`, 153 of 164
repos (the sweep was stopped at its time budget), load average 2.08 at
start:

| | total | median per-repo | faster / slower |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| repos ≥150 ms (90 of them) | — | **+0.0%** | 43 / 40 |
| all 153 repos | 240,095 → 250,373 ms (+4.3%) | | |
| all 153 **excluding `erlang-otp`** | **+0.1%** | | |

**That +4.3% is one repository.** `erlang-otp` went 26,181 → 36,277 ms,
which is **98% of the entire delta** while being 10.9% of the baseline
total. It is the corpus's known pathological case — 177 MB, 3,851 `.erl`
files, the repo CLAUDE.md records as having run for 3h40m in an
unguarded sweep. A formatter change cannot cause it: the timed command
never renders mermaid. Reported here rather than smoothed into the total,
because promoting exactly this shape to a corpus-wide claim is the
mistake 0.6.2 had to retract.

Corroborating that the deltas are noise: `rust-salvo` read **-20.3%** in
one sweep and **-0.4%** in a clean repeat of the same two commits.

**What did change, measured directly** — the rendered artifact, which is
what mermaid's cost actually is for its consumer:

| `cgg ./crates -t mermaid` | bytes | `o200k_base` tokens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.8.1 (hashed ids) | 275,772 | 127,536 |
| 0.8.2 (numbered ids) | 209,237 | 80,360 |
| delta | **-24.1%** | **-37.0%** |

Corpus-wide, all 164 repos: 217,119,809 → 172,590,073 bytes, **-20.5%**.
The token saving outruns the byte saving because a random base36 string
costs roughly one token per two characters while `N7` is one token.

**Recall under `--rollup` improves, and that is the practical effect.**
The budget is a claim about *rendered* size, so a smaller rendering means
a finer granularity fits. At `--rollup 100k` across all 164 repos:
135 repos fold to the same granularity, **29 fold finer, none fold
coarser**, and total nodes emitted go 109,558 → 149,413 — **+36.4% more
of the graph retained for the same budget**. `scala-play` goes from
`package` (11 nodes) to `module` (2,058); `graphql-github` from 3 nodes
to the full 1,625-node graph.

Test suite: 778 tests, unchanged in runtime. The pre-commit hook is
unaffected; its `cgg` invocations now write ~24% less to `target/`.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-22

**Output-side only. The analysis is untouched.** No resolver phase, no
plugin, no framework rule and no id derivation changed, and the graph
this release builds for a given tree is the same graph 0.8.0 built —
verified by running both binaries over one fixed tree: `mermaid`, `dot`
and `graphml` come back byte-identical. Everything below is about what
gets *emitted* from that graph and how it can be sliced afterwards.

### Added — `--rollup`, `--rollup-by`, `--from-graph`

- **`--rollup BUDGET` folds the graph to a coarser granularity when the
  rendered output would exceed a token budget.** The default graph of a
  real tree does not fit in a context window — this repo's own `crates/`
  is ~2,200 callables and ~5,200 edges, 123,000 tokens of mermaid —
  and the view usually wanted at that size is "which module calls which",
  not "which function calls which". Budgets accept `100k`, `120000`,
  `1.5m`. A graph already under budget is left **byte-identical**, so the
  flag is safe to leave in a wrapper script.

- **`--rollup-by LEVEL` names the granularity outright:** `callable`,
  `type`, `module`, `file`, `package`, `dir:N`, `language`. With
  `--rollup` it is a floor the budget may coarsen past. `package` is the
  nearest ancestor directory holding a build manifest (`Cargo.toml`,
  `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml` and friends) — the only
  level that reads the filesystem, falling back to `dir:1` where it finds
  none. Measured on `cgg ./crates`: 2196 nodes at `callable`, 365 at
  `type`, 241 at `module`, 141 at `file`, 26 at `package`, 21 at
  `language`.

  Rollup is a `Graph` -> `Graph` transform in the pipeline, not a
  formatter mode, so all four output formats and all four front ends get
  it from one implementation. It runs last — after `--filter`/`-n`, after
  `--exclude-*`, after dead-code marking — and composes with all of them.

- **`--from-graph FILE` re-queries a graph saved by an earlier `-t json`
  run** instead of walking source. `-t json` already wrote a document
  `serde` could read back; this is the reader plus the guardrails one
  needs. `--filter`, `-n`, `--exclude-*` and `--rollup` all apply to the
  loaded graph and produce byte-identical output to the same flags run
  against the tree.

- `-t json` now carries `"schema": "cgg.graph.v1"` and the writing cgg
  version, as two wrapper keys. Node ids are explicitly not comparable
  across versions, so an unlabelled or mismatched document is a warning
  and a different schema is an error rather than a silent misread.

- New `weight` field on an edge: how many call sites it stands for.
  Always `1` in an ordinary graph, and only a fold raises it. `mermaid`
  and `dot` fold it into their existing `Nx` label; `graphml` gains a
  `weight` edge attribute, whose `<key>` is declared only when some edge
  uses it; JSON skips the field entirely when it is `1`.

  **Default output is unchanged.** Verified by running this build and a
  pristine 0.8.0 build over the same fixed tree: `mermaid`, `dot` and
  `graphml` are byte-identical. `-t json` differs by exactly the two new
  wrapper keys (`schema`, `cgg_version`) plus the per-file parse timings
  that already differ between any two runs.

- New `CallableKind::Group` and a `rollup` field on a callable, carrying
  the member/file/language/internal-call counts a group node stands for.
  A distinct kind rather than borrowing `Function`, because a consumer
  filtering `kind == "method"` must not be handed a directory — and it
  can only appear in a graph the caller explicitly asked to roll up.

- New audit events: `rolled_up` (the level chosen, the budget, every
  granularity measured and rejected, and whether the budget was met) and
  `graph_replayed`.

- **All four front ends carry the whole surface.** The CLI, `cgg-py`
  (`rollup=`, `rollup_by=`, `rollup_format=`, `from_graph=`, plus
  `Callable.rollup` and `Edge.weight`), `cgg-node` (the same in
  camelCase, with `RollupInfo` and regenerated `index.d.ts`), and
  `cgg-ffi` — which needed **no ABI change at all**: options cross as a
  JSON document precisely so a new feature does not add an entry point,
  and that held. Verified from C, Python and JavaScript against the same
  trees the CLI was run on.

  `cgg-node`'s graph-type conversions now destructure with no `..` rest,
  the guard `cgg-py` already used. Without it the option keywords reached
  the pipeline while `Callable.rollup` and `Edge.weight` did not, so
  JavaScript could ask for a fold and be unable to observe it, and a
  folded edge's call count was dropped at the boundary. That is a build
  error now.

### Honesty properties

- **A rollup is never silent.** It is announced on stderr — and unlike
  every other advisory, **`-q` does not suppress it**, because it is the
  only thing distinguishing a graph of your code from a graph of your
  directory layout. It is also stated in a comment header inside the
  mermaid itself, so it survives copy-paste of the block, and recorded in
  the audit.
- **A budget that cannot be met says so** rather than returning something
  over it quietly. If no granularity renders smaller than the un-rolled
  graph — which happens on trees small enough for the banner and the
  per-node member tags to dominate — the un-rolled graph is returned,
  because a "budgeted" artifact larger than the unbudgeted one is
  strictly worse than not having the flag.
- **Aggregation follows the logic, not convenience.** A group edge's
  confidence is the **maximum** over the edges it folds ("at least one
  call exists" is a disjunction — as strong as its best evidence);
  `unreferenced` is the **minimum** and is set only when *every* member
  carries it ("nothing calls anything in here" is a conjunction, which
  one referenced member falsifies).
- **`--from-graph` refuses what it cannot honour.** `--dead-code`,
  `--include-external`, `--dynamic-dispatch`, `--since` and `--lang` all
  need analysis-time facts a saved graph does not contain; each is
  rejected with the reason rather than silently producing an ordinary
  graph. A document that was itself filtered is detected (its metrics
  outnumber its contents) and warned about, because replaying it can only
  narrow it further.
- **`<framework-entry>` nodes fold by `(trust kind, framework)`,** not by
  path. They share one sentinel path, so a path-based level would
  collapse every entry in the tree into a single node — destroying the
  one thing an entry node exists to say. Folding on the framework keeps
  that and the trust boundary, and states the count
  (`⟨412 framework entries — INFERRED⟩`). A framework with a single entry
  passes through whole, because folding it would gain nothing and cost
  its route.

  Exempting them from rollup entirely was tried first and is wrong: it
  gives `--rollup` a floor it cannot get under. On `java-spring-batch`,
  10,639 callables fold to **two** language groups while **412** entry
  nodes pass through untouched and are 99% of the output — about 50,000
  tokens no granularity could reduce, so `--rollup 40k` failed at every
  rung and could only warn. Folding on the framework, that repo fits at
  `package` in 1,122 tokens.
- **The token count is an estimate, is documented as one, and is
  calibrated against a measurement.** No tokenizer ships in the binary —
  cgg is offline, deterministic and single-binary, and a BPE vocabulary
  is none of those at the size it would add. The count is
  `max(words x 2.5, bytes / 1.8)`.

  The divisor is measured, not a rule of thumb. `bytes / 3.5` — the usual
  figure for code — was tried first and under-counts cgg's own output by
  about half, which makes the budget not a bound at all: `--rollup 40k`
  returned 65-80k real tokens. Mermaid is far denser than prose because
  40% of it is base36 node ids and `::`-dense qualified names. Both
  columns below are measured, not projected:

  | target | real tokens | `bytes/3.5` | `bytes/1.8` |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `cgg/crates` full | 123,639 | 76,496 (0.62x) | 148,781 (1.20x) |
  | `cgg/crates` type | 25,438 | 13,526 (0.53x) | 27,116 (1.07x) |
  | `cgg/crates` file | 14,648 | 7,823 (0.53x) | 15,527 (1.06x) |
  | `cgg/crates` package | 1,890 | 1,216 (0.64x) | 2,424 (1.28x) |
  | `ripgrep` full | 162,291 | 101,521 (0.63x) | 197,402 (1.22x) |
  | `ripgrep` type | 35,505 | 18,750 (0.53x) | 37,491 (1.06x) |
  | `redis` full | 789,069 | 429,660 (0.54x) | 835,451 (1.06x) |
  | `redis` file | 72,666 | 36,950 (0.51x) | 73,615 (1.01x) |

  1.8 is the bottom of the measured 1.78-2.25 range on purpose: the
  estimate should **bound** the real count, not split it. Erring high
  costs one extra rung of folding; erring low hands back an artifact over
  the budget, which is the failure the flag exists to prevent. Range is
  now 1.01-1.28x — never under.

  Calibrated against `o200k_base`, a proxy for token density rather than
  the tokenizer any particular model charges. A 2x error is much larger
  than the spread between BPE families, so the correction holds either
  way; the residual 10-25% slack is the tokenizer-specific part. README,
  `--help` and the skill state the measured range.

### Fixed

- Qualified-name splitting in the rollup keys is bracket-aware. A plain
  `rfind` lands inside a Rust trait-impl wrapper and produced the group
  name `cgg::cli::<cgg_format::OutputFormat` — a dangling bracket, and a
  type nobody wrote.
- `clippy::collapsible_match` in `cgg-lang/src/plugins/clojure.rs`, which
  failed `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` on
  current clippy before any of this work. Unrelated to the feature;
  fixed because it blocked the gate.
- **`CallableNode` no longer carries `RollupMeta` inline.** The struct is
  held one-per-callable for a whole run, and the 64-byte field grew it
  208 -> 272 bytes: a 31% widening of the hottest structure in the
  pipeline, paid by every analysis to carry something that is `None`
  unless someone passed `--rollup`. A corpus-wide paired A/B put the cost
  at +2.9%. Boxed, the field costs 8 bytes and the struct is 216; the
  allocation is paid only by group nodes, which are by construction few,
  and `Box<T>` is serde-transparent so the wire format does not move.
  `CallEdge` was measured too and is unchanged at 88 bytes — `weight`
  landed in padding that already existed. `crates/cgg-core/tests/sizes.rs`
  pins both numbers, because the growth happened and nothing noticed
  until a timing run went looking.

### Performance

Paired A/B against the 0.8.0 baseline, both binaries built from this
machine's cache and run alternately over the same tree — `cgg ./crates`
(2,196 callables, 5,214 edges) at `--jobs 1`, 7 pairs, wall clock from
each run's own summary line:

| | median | min | max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.8.0 baseline | 973.5 ms | 952.0 | 1038.2 |
| 0.8.1 | 965.7 ms | 939.9 | 1028.7 |

Median delta **-0.8%**. Per-pair deltas run +5.1%, -0.9%, -1.6%, +2.0%,
+0.9%, -6.0%, -4.9% — a spread wider than the median difference in both
directions, which is noise, not a move. That is the expected result:
`apply_rollup` returns before rendering anything when neither flag is
set, so the default path gains one branch.

Cost of the new paths, same tree, wall clock per run:

| Run | Times |
| --- | ----- |
| default (no rollup) | 467 / 346 / 356 ms |
| `--rollup 40k` (folds at `type`) | 422 / 437 / 373 ms |
| `--rollup 1k` (walks every rung) | 364 / 374 / 435 ms |
| `--rollup-by module` | 410 / 438 ms |
| `--from-graph` + `--rollup-by module` | 108 / 63 / 74 ms |

Folding is one O(V+E) pass per rung and every render after the first is
of a dramatically smaller graph, so even a budget that walks the whole
ladder stays inside run-to-run variance.

`--from-graph` is the number that matters: ~70 ms against ~360 ms,
because it skips walking, parsing and resolving entirely.

#### Corpus A/B against 0.8.0

`scripts/perf-compare.sh` against `affee30`, median of 5 per repo, on a
64-core Linux host with the 164-repo corpus.

The first run — before the `CallableNode` boxing above — came back
**+2.9%** over 97 repos (142,965 ms -> 147,135 ms) before its 30-minute
budget stopped it. That is above the script's own ~1-1.5% noise floor and
was the signal that found the struct growth; nothing in the rollup pass
explains it, because `apply_rollup` returns before rendering when neither
flag is set.

After boxing, over 14 repos chosen for callable density (258,885
callables — the population the regression scales with, deliberately
excluding `erlang-otp` and `zig-zig`, which add ten minutes and no
signal):

| | 0.8.0 | 0.8.1 | delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **total** | 33,745 ms | 33,618 ms | **-0.4%** |
| median per repo | | | **+1.05%** |

Per-repo range -2.1% to +6.6%, with sub-150ms repos flagged noisy by the
script. Both readings sit inside the noise floor, so this is **flat** —
not an improvement. Two caveats, stated rather than buried: `scala-spark`
is 24s of the 33.7s total, so the total is weighted heavily toward one
repo, which is why the median is quoted beside it; and this is a single
run, not the repeated pair the script asks for before *claiming* a
change. Claiming flat needs less evidence than claiming a win, which is
the direction this errs.

Timings are from an x86_64 host; the single-tree numbers above were taken
on aarch64. They are not comparable to each other and are not presented
as such.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-19

### Changed — BREAKING: node ids are content-derived, not sequential

- **`CallableId`/`FileId` are now stable, content-derived hashes instead
  of a per-run sequential counter.** Every emitted graph — mermaid,
  json, dot, graphml — previously numbered nodes `0, 1, 2, …` in
  file-discovery order, so the same source tree could mint a different
  id for the same function from one run to the next (a new file
  appearing earlier in the walk order shifts every id after it), and an
  id was meaningless outside the run that produced it. An id is now a
  blake3 hash of the node's own identity — a file's relative path, or a
  callable's `(language, file path, owner qualified name, qualified
  name, signature hint)` — so **the same node gets the
  same id on every run**, and adding, removing or editing an unrelated
  file never changes it.

  The signature is part of the key because the first four components are
  **not unique**. A file that declares several callables sharing a
  qualified name — overloads, which C++, C#, Java and Erlang have in
  quantity — hashes them identically. Over the 113-repo benchmark corpus
  that is **309,347 of 1,745,670 callables (17.7%)**, peaking at 52.8%
  in one repo, and every one of them falls through to the collision path
  where the id is decided by declaration order rather than content. That
  breaks the guarantee this change exists to provide: delete the first
  of two overloads and the second inherits its id, so a consumer diffing
  ids across runs reads "unchanged" while the id now names a different
  function. Including the signature takes that population to **2.25%** —
  the residual being callables cgg genuinely cannot tell apart, where no
  key can do better.

  **The path component is relative to the analysis root, not the path
  you typed.** `cgg-walk` reports each file under the root it was given,
  so hashing the raw path made an id a function of the invocation rather
  than of the code — the same file, same content, same name produced
  four different ids:

  ```text
  cgg /tmp/smoke2   Ck1v6lk3phz
  cgg smoke2        Cf83zjoounv
  cgg .             Cn10c7f0lc7
  cgg t.py          Cvgb78ftyly
  ```

  That defeated the point: two checkouts at different paths, or CI and a
  laptop, would agree on the graph and disagree on every id in it. With
  one root the root is now stripped entirely, so ids are
  location-independent; with several roots the root's directory name is
  kept as a prefix, because `src/m.py` and `tests/m.py` are different
  files and collapsing both to `m.py` would push them into the
  order-dependent redraw. Three regression tests cover it — nothing did
  before.

  `start_byte` was measured as an alternative and rejected. It is unique
  corpus-wide, but it churns on movement — one comment line added at the
  top of `spdlog`'s busiest header moved 135 of 1,157 ids, destroying
  the diffability this change exists for — and it still lets a survivor
  inherit a deleted sibling's id, because removing a definition shifts
  the next one into its byte offset.

  What holds: editing an unrelated file changes nothing, moving code
  within a file changes nothing (verified by running `cargo fmt --all`
  over cgg's own tree — 318 callables, 0 ids changed), and removing one
  overload leaves its siblings alone.

  A collision, if one ever occurs, is resolved by drawing the next
  window from the same node's own hash stream — never by comparing to
  whichever other node it collided with. Every draw is 52 bits wide, so
  **no id ever exceeds 52 bits**; that bound is what keeps `cgg-node`'s
  `number` binding exact.

  **Wire format changed too.** An id used to be a bare integer
  (`{"src": 0, "dst": 1}` in JSON; `C0`, `n0` in mermaid/dot/graphml).
  It is now the type's prefix character followed by lowercase base36
  digits (`{"src": "C4k2j9qh3xz"}`; `Chco17z7ulm`, `nhco17z7ulm`). This
  is unconditional — there is no flag and no fallback to the old
  numeric scheme, because only a handful of consumers depend on raw id
  values today and every one of them (the CLI's own formatters,
  `cgg-py`, `cgg-node`) was updated in this same change.

  **If you store or diff raw ids across runs, this changes what you see
  even though the graph is unchanged**: ids no longer renumber on every
  run, so a diff against a previous run's ids is now meaningful for the
  first time — but a diff against pre-upgrade output will show every id
  as new, once. `cgg-py`'s `Callable.id`/`Edge.src`/`Edge.dst`/
  `File.id` are `u64` now (Python's `int` already covers the range, so
  nothing on the Python side needed a type change beyond that).
  `cgg-node`'s equivalents are `i64` on the Rust side and `number` in
  the generated `index.d.ts` — N-API has no native `u64` binding, and
  `number` is exact here only because every id stays inside 52 bits,
  comfortably under `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53-1).
  Verified: across the corpus no `cgg-node` id is negative, unsafe, or
  disagrees with the value the CLI reports for the same callable.
  `cgg-node`'s `Graph.files` getter, which used to return
  `Array<string>` of bare paths indexed by `Callable.file`, now returns
  `Array<{ id, path }>` — matching by id was already how `cgg-py`
  worked, and the old "index equals id" invariant depended on the
  sequential scheme this change removes. `cgg-ffi`'s C ABI is
  unaffected: it never exposed raw ids, only rendered strings/JSON, by
  design.

### Performance

- Measured with `scripts/perf-compare.sh` against `072dbb0`, the commit
  0.7.0 shipped from plus one docs-only commit (`git diff --name-only
  ea9fbef 072dbb0` matches no `.rs`/`.toml`/`.lock` file, so it is
  perf-identical to the 0.7.0 release). Median of 7 runs per repo,
  alternating which binary goes first. Machine load at measurement time:
  **2.90, 3.17, 4.32** on a 64-thread host.

  The corpus budget stopped the sweep after **67 of 113 repos**
  (alphabetical prefix, through `erlang-otp`). That is a partial sweep
  and is stated as one rather than presented as full coverage.

  | comparison | median per-repo | total (excl. `erlang-otp`) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 0.8.0 vs 0.7.0 | **+3.5%** | +2.9% |

  So content-derived ids cost roughly **3%** — a blake3 hash and a
  `HashSet` probe per callable replacing an integer increment. Against
  the harness's own stated noise floor of 1–1.5% on a total, the
  per-repo median is a real cost, not jitter. **The comparison is
  like-for-like**: this release enables no new work by default, and the
  resulting graph is byte-identical to 0.7.0's on all 113 corpus repos
  (nodes and edges by name, including `via` and confidence).

  Regressions over 5% on repos whose baseline exceeds 150 ms:
  `bash-acme` +12.9% (155→175 ms), `app-spring-mall` +10.6%
  (406→449 ms), `app-eshop-aspnet` +7.0%, `app-vaultwarden-rocket`
  +6.8%, `app-flaskbb-flask` +6.1%, `app-thingsboard-concurrent` +5.9%
  (5732→6072 ms), `elixir-phoenix` +5.5%, `app-druid-jaxrs` +5.4%. All
  are the same per-callable hashing cost; none is a repo-shape effect,
  and the move is corpus-wide rather than one repository — 51 of 67
  slower, 14 faster, 2 flat.

  **`erlang-otp` is excluded from the total and the exclusion is the
  point.** The same binary measured 26,651 ms in one sweep and 36,280 ms
  in another — a 36% spread with no code change between them. A direct
  alternating measurement (5 samples, median, default jobs) puts it at
  **26.9 s against 0.7.0's 28.1 s**, i.e. slightly faster, so the large
  positive deltas some sweeps report for it are machine contention, not
  a regression. It is 28% of the corpus total, so leaving it in swings
  the headline number by ten points in either direction. This is the
  trap 0.6.x fell into and CLAUDE.md records: quote the median, not a
  total one repository can dominate.

  Developer-facing latency, on the same host:

  | | timing |
  | --- | --- |
  | `cargo test --workspace` (warm) | 5.9 s / 6.1 s / 14.0 s cold |
  | `.githooks/pre-commit` end to end | 6.8 s / 6.8 s |

  Two changes in this release were made *because* they were measured.
  Keeping the mermaid/dot dedup keys `Copy` avoids two `String`
  allocations per edge plus two more per lookup. And the redundant
  `include_by_last` sort in `cross_file.rs` was dropped rather than
  re-keyed: sorting those buckets by `PathBuf` cost **+30% on
  `erlang-otp`** on its own, and the buckets are already built in
  discovery order, so the sort never did anything.

### Testing

- **The determinism sweep now covers the whole corpus, and runs in
  processes.** Three defaults made it both slower and weaker than it
  read. `--repos` defaulted to 14 of 113, so a green sweep described a
  random eighth of the corpus while sounding like it described all of
  it. `--runs` defaulted to 4, but determinism is a pairwise property —
  every run is compared against the first, so run 2 is the one that can
  detect a difference and later runs are only further chances at an
  intermittent one; with ~5.5k cells across the corpus, breadth samples
  that far better than depth per cell. And the sweep ran strictly
  serially.

  Parallelising it with threads changed nothing — 142s / 139s / 146s at
  4 / 8 / 16 workers over a fixed subset, with python at 102% CPU and
  zero cgg children. The cost is this script, not cgg: `json.loads` ->
  `strip_timings` -> `json.dumps` over multi-megabyte graphs, which is
  GIL-bound. Processes fixed it:

  | executor | 8w | 16w | 32w | 48w |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | ThreadPool | 140s | 139s | 146s | — |
  | ProcessPool | 80s | 49s | 42s | 37s |

  ~3.8x at the new default of `cores/2`.

- **16 framework rules now have a real application behind them.**
  `APPS_UNVERIFIED` — rules cgg detects but that nothing proves it can
  *enumerate* — goes from 45 to 29, and 121 rules now enumerate entry
  points in a real application. The distinction matters: a rule that
  detects without enumerating leaves every handler of that framework at
  in-degree zero, which is not merely incomplete but wrong.

  The applications are projects *built on* each framework, not the
  framework's own repository. An earlier attempt used the framework
  repos and they do enumerate — but only because their own test suites
  exercise their own decorators, which is close to circular. `martini`
  made the point: `go-martini/martini` does not import itself, so its
  import-path detect never fired at all.

  Two rules stay unverified with their real reason recorded rather than
  boilerplate. `martini` is a **cgg gap**: `martini-contrib/render`
  registers 21 routes as `m.Get("/x", func(...){...})` and cgg records a
  value reference only for a bare identifier, so an inline closure
  handler binds to no callable. `symfony-messenger` has no application
  using the component.

  This also fixed three stale `~` gap markers and eight never-cloned
  cloud APPS entries, so `scripts/framework-coverage.py` exits 0 again.

### Compatibility / migration

- **The default graph is unchanged.** Verified across all 113 benchmark
  repositories: nodes and edges compare identical to 0.7.0 by name,
  including `via` and confidence. Only the *identifiers* changed.
- **Raw ids are not comparable across versions.** A diff of ids against
  pre-0.8.0 output shows every node as new, once. From 0.8.0 forward a
  diff against a previous run is meaningful for the first time.
- **JSON ids are strings, not numbers.** `{"src": 0}` is now
  `{"src": "C4k2j9qh3xz"}`, and the `callables`/`files` objects are
  keyed by the same string. jq expressions calling `tonumber` on an id
  will fail; drop the coercion.
- **`cgg-py`**: `Callable.id`, `Edge.src`, `Edge.dst` and `File.id` are
  `u64`. Python's `int` already covers the range, so no caller change is
  needed unless it assumed ids were small or sequential.
- **`cgg-node`**: the same fields are `number`, and `Graph.files` now
  returns `Array<{ id, path }>` instead of `Array<string>` indexed by
  `Callable.file` — that indexing only worked while ids were sequential.
  Match by id.
- **`cgg-ffi`**: unaffected. The C ABI never exposed raw ids, only
  rendered strings and JSON, which is why it needed no change.

  **`erlang-otp` is excluded from the totals above and the exclusion is
  the point.** The same binary measured 26,651 ms in one sweep and
  36,280 ms in another — a 36% spread with no code change between them.
  A direct alternating measurement (5 samples, median) puts it at
  **26.9 s against `main`'s 28.1 s**, i.e. slightly *faster*, so the
  large positive deltas that appear for it in some sweeps are machine
  contention rather than a regression. It is 28% of the corpus total, so
  leaving it in swings the headline number by ten points in either
  direction. This is the same trap CLAUDE.md records for 0.6.x: quote
  the median, not a total one repo can dominate.

  Two changes in this branch were made *because* they were measured, not
  because they looked cleaner. Keeping the mermaid/dot dedup keys `Copy`
  avoids two `String` allocations per edge plus two more per lookup. And
  the redundant `include_by_last` sort in `cross_file.rs` was dropped
  rather than re-keyed: sorting those buckets by `PathBuf` to restore
  discovery order cost **+30% on `erlang-otp`** on its own, and the
  buckets are already built in discovery order, so the sort was never
  doing anything.

### Added

- **Cloud entry points across five platforms and sixteen languages.**
  Google Cloud Functions had no rule in any language; Azure, Cloudflare
  and Deno detected their framework and enumerated nothing from it.
  Ruby and PHP — *first-party managed runtimes* on Lambda and Cloud
  Functions, as officially supported as Python — had no cloud rule at
  all.

  | Platform | Runtimes |
  | --- | --- |
  | AWS Lambda | Go, Java, Python, JS, TS, C#, Rust, **Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, Swift, C++** |

  Verified on real repositories, all now APPS entries:

  and 2 JS entries), both Azure quickstarts, `cloudflare/workers-rs`,
  `denoland/std`, `powertools-lambda-python` (1,282 entries),
  `aws-cdk-examples`.

- **`--fanout-cap`, `--no-graph`, `--report-unreferenced`**, an
  `unresolved_by_module` audit event, and five specific
  `UnresolvedReason` variants replacing the blanket
  `no-candidate-in-file`.

- **The span profiler is compiled into every build.** It was
  `#[cfg]`-compiled out of release, so the one build anyone runs could
  not answer "where is this dwelling?" — exactly the question a
  pathological input raises, and one a debug build cannot answer because
  it distorts the ratios. `--profile` now enables collection at runtime.
  Four quadratics were found with it within the hour.

### Fixed

> **Four superlinear resolver paths made large inputs unusable.**
> `erlang-otp` ran for **3 hours 40 minutes** without finishing;
> `cmake-kitware`, `dart-flutter` and `zig-zig` timed out. Any run that
> did complete produced a correct graph — no published number was wrong
> — but four repositories in the benchmark corpus could not be analysed
> at all, and the corpus scripts had no timeout, so a sweep containing
> one of them never returned.

- **`enclosing_callable_id` scanned every callable in the graph, per
  reference.** On Zig's compiler that is 572,840 references against
  344,808 callables. The reference loop was 449s of CPU while the
  resolution inside it was 1.8s. Indexed by `(file, start, end)`.
- **The `#include` closure had no memo**, so a C include diamond was
  re-walked exponentially — 25 includes at depth 8. Fixed with a *depth
  map*, not a visited set: `depth` counts down, so a plain set would
  refuse to re-expand a header first reached by a long path and lose the
  deeper definitions, order-dependently.
- **Include resolution scanned every file** per include per file;
  `HashMap` iteration is unordered, so even the exact-match
  short-circuit read half the map and a miss read all of it.
- **The FFI duplicate check scanned the whole edge list** per candidate
  per reference.

- **Multi-argument generics were dropped from every base-type rule.**
  `implements RequestHandler<String, String>` was truncated by a
  `trim_end_matches` that could not tell a generic's `>` from the
  container's delimiter. Not Lambda-specific: **MediatR** went from
  `entries NOT enumerated` to enumerating.
- **Kotlin, Scala and Groovy recorded no base types**, so every
  `base_types` rule for them was inert — including `android-worker`,
  `spring-batch` and `gradle-plugin`, which had never fired. F#, Scala
  and Groovy recorded no attributes.
- **JS/TS options objects were invisible to registrar capture**, which
  is how Azure's v4 model writes every handler.

### Changed

- **Corpus scripts are time-bounded.** `CGG_REPO_TIMEOUT` (60s/repo) and
  `CGG_TOTAL_BUDGET` (1800s/run) now bound `benchmark.sh`,
  `perf-compare.sh` and `framework-coverage.py` — whose per-repo cap was
  900s, which across a hundred repos is not a timeout. A repo that trips
  the cap is named and excluded, never silently averaged in.

- **`perf-compare.sh` now measures the whole corpus.** It measured nine
  hand-picked repos totalling **1.8 seconds** — 0.7% of the corpus's
  258s — and it is the same nine that produced the "+4–6.8% corpus-wide
  regression" this project retracted in 0.6.2. It contained none of the
  repos where this release's quadratics lived, so it would have reported
  *flat* for a fix that took `erlang-otp` from 3h40m to 24.5s.

- **A fifth optimisation was reverted.** An inverted
  `(language, path fragment)` index took `hcl-terraform-aws` to 16.6s;
  the full-corpus sweep caught it losing **9,331 nodes and edges across
  34 repositories**. The match is `path.contains(fragment)`, which
  permits a fragment to begin mid-segment, and no segment-aligned index
  reproduces that. `hcl` is 49s instead of 17s as a direct result.

### Performance

Machine load at measurement: see below. Comparison is **not**
like-for-like in one direction — this release enables cloud rules for
nine more languages that the baseline did not have, so some of the added
edges are new default work.

`scripts/perf-compare.sh` against `v0.6.7`, 9-repo smoke set, `--jobs 1`:

| repo | 0.6.7 | 0.7.0 | delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 193 ms | 185 ms | -4.1% |
| python-flask | 84 ms | 89 ms | +6.0% (noise) |
| js-express | 66 ms | 72 ms | +9.1% (noise) |
| go-fzf | 166 ms | 158 ms | -4.8% |
| c-jq | 99 ms | 94 ms | -5.1% (noise) |
| cpp-spdlog | 266 ms | 253 ms | -4.9% |
| csharp-serilog | 94 ms | 98 ms | +4.3% (noise) |
| swift-alamofire | 193 ms | 194 ms | +0.5% |
| cpp-nlohmann-json | 628 ms | 611 ms | -2.7% |
| **TOTAL** | **1789 ms** | **1754 ms** | **-2.0%** |

The script's own noise floor on that total is ~1–1.5%, so **-2.0% is
flat**, not an improvement. Every per-repo move flagged `(noise)` has a
baseline under 150 ms.

**The corpus is the real number, and it is not comparable as a total**,
because 0.6.7 could not finish four of its repositories:

| repo | 0.6.7 | 0.7.0 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| erlang-otp | 3h 40m, never finished | **24.5s** |
| cmake-kitware | timed out | **4.4s** |
| dart-flutter | timed out | **15.3s** |
| zig-zig | timed out | **48.2s** |
| hcl-terraform-aws | 62s | 49.2s |

Whole corpus, 113 repositories, 185,222 files, 1,745,670 callables,
7.7 GB, `--jobs 8`, one pass each: **258s**, with **89 repos under one
second**, 6 between 10s and 60s, and **none over two minutes**.

Graph size against a clean `v0.6.7` build, all 113 repositories:
**nodes 1,000,768 → 1,745,670 (+74.4%)**, **edges 1,904,932 → 2,382,130
(+25.1%)**, with **zero repositories losing a single node or edge**.
Most of that gain is the four repositories that previously produced no
graph at all; excluding them, 49 repositories gain from the new rules
and the capture fixes, led by `app-rails-mastodon` (+897 nodes),
`js-express` (+552) and `app-saleor-celery` (+427 edges).

Test suite: **690 tests in 5.1s**. Gates (test + clippy + fmt +
docs-check) total **6.7s**.

### Compatibility

The default graph remains a superset of 0.6.7's: no repository in the
corpus lost a node or an edge. Two behaviour changes are worth naming:
scoping the registrar-verb gate per language moves JS/TS dead-code
findings (-69 on Ghost, +6 on cal.com), and inline handlers that carry
no route string now register, which adds synthesized handler nodes
(+1.4% on Ghost).

### Added / Fixed / Changed — cloud entry points (filed late)

These three subsections describe work that shipped **in 0.7.0** but
was left under `## [Unreleased]` when that release was cut, so it sat
unattributed until the 0.8.0 bump found it. Moved here rather than
rolled into 0.8.0, which would have claimed already-released features
as new. The summary bullet and language table above cover the same
work; these add the per-platform detail.

### Added — cloud entry points

- **Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Firebase, Cloudflare
  Workers and Deno** — 18 enumerating rules across five platforms.
  Google Cloud Functions had **no rule in any language**; Azure,
  Cloudflare and Deno detected their framework and enumerated nothing
  from it.

  | Platform | Runtimes | Mechanism |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Google Cloud Functions | Python, JS, TS, Go, Java, C# | Functions Framework decorators, `functions.http('name', h)`, and the `HttpFunction`/`IHttpFunction` contracts |
  | Azure Functions | C#, Java, Python, JS, TS | `[Function]`/`[FunctionName]`/`@FunctionName`, the v2 Python decorators, v4's `app.http('name', { handler })` |
  | Firebase Functions | JS, TS, Python | v2 trigger registrars, `@https_fn.on_request` |
  | Cloudflare Workers | JS, TS | module-worker `fetch`/`scheduled`/`queue`/`email`, plus legacy `addEventListener('fetch', …)` |
  | Deno | JS, TS | `Deno.serve` handlers, default-exported `fetch` |

  Verified on real repositories, each now an APPS entry:
  `functions-framework-nodejs` (3 entries), `firebase/functions-samples`
  (17 Python + 2 JS), both Azure quickstarts (2 each),
  `cloudflare/workers-rs` (3), `denoland/std` (1).

### Fixed — cloud entry points

- **A registration needed a route string, and three platforms had
  none.** `is_registration_shape` required a leading string literal
  before it would name an inline handler, so `Deno.serve((req) => …)`,
  Firebase's `onRequest((req, res) => …)` and Express middleware
  `app.use(fn)` enumerated nothing.

  The string was never what made that gate safe — the caller's
  *registrar-verb* gate is, and `describe`, `it`, `map`, `then` and
  `setTimeout` are registrar verbs in no rule. Measured before removing
  it: **+1.4% nodes on Ghost, +0.1% on cal.com**, and wall clock
  unchanged to slightly faster.

- **Inline closures inside an options object were invisible.** Azure
  Functions' v4 model writes every handler as
  `app.http("name", { handler: async (req, ctx) => … })`, and only
  argument position was scanned — the whole runtime enumerated nothing.
  `javascript.rs` also carried its own copy of the closure scan rather
  than calling the shared helper, so fixing the helper alone was not
  enough.

- **Cloudflare's detection missed `@cloudflare/workers-types`**, the
  import a TypeScript Worker actually uses, so the commonest Worker in
  existence was not detected at all.

### Changed — cloud entry points

- **Firebase's deprecated v1 vocabulary is deliberately not
  registered.** `onCreate`/`onUpdate`/`onDelete`/`onWrite`/`onRun`
  collide with ORM lifecycle hooks and event emitters across the whole
  language, and verb gating happens at extraction time — carrying them
  cost a measured **5.3% on Ghost and 1.9% on Immich** for a deprecated
  API. Bisected by stripping rule groups one at a time; Azure's verbs,
  by contrast, cost -0.2%. A named v1 handler still binds by value
  reference; only its entry label is lost.

  Net effect of the whole change set, nine paired runs at `--jobs 1`
  against 0.6.7: **-3.1% median, -2.0% min** on Ghost.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-08-14

**CI smoke test. No functional change** — the graph 0.6.7 produces is
byte-identical to 0.6.6's.

0.6.6's `publish` job failed after all fourteen build jobs passed: the
root npm package's `prepublishOnly` re-runs `napi prepublish`, and
`napi` is not on PATH in that step, so `npm publish` exited 127. Five
platform packages shipped at 0.6.6 while the root stayed at 0.6.5 — the
split-brain the post-publish verification check exists to catch, and it
did catch it. The root package was then published by hand and the
workflow fixed to pass `--ignore-scripts`.

That fix cannot be exercised except by tagging, so this release exists
to tag.

**Result: the fix works, and the smoke test earned its keep by finding a
second bug.** `npm publish --ignore-scripts` succeeded
(`+ cgg-callgraphgenerator@0.6.7`) and all three channels shipped — PyPI
five wheels and an sdist, npm root plus five platform packages, three
GitHub release binaries, none of it by hand.

The `publish` job still went red, on the verification check itself: it
read `npm view` **one second** after the publish and got 0.6.6, because
`dist-tags` propagation through the registry CDN takes a few seconds.
A false alarm on the one check whose value is being trustworthy — the
next real split-brain would be waved through as "just the propagation
thing". It now polls for up to five minutes instead of reading once.

## [0.6.6] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- **The three enhancements from the same field report.**

  **Duck-typed fan-out is narrowed by what a candidate can accept.** A
  call passing `data=`/`context=` fanned out to four same-named
  `evaluate` methods, three of which accept neither keyword and require
  four others. Keyword names are now captured at the call site and
  checked against each candidate's `signature_hint` — which the
  extractors already recorded, so no new extraction. Measured on the
  reported shape: **4 candidates → 1**.

  Deliberately one-sided. A candidate is eliminated only when a keyword
  is *provably* not one of its parameters and it has no `**kwargs`; an
  unparseable signature accepts anything, and if narrowing would empty
  the set the original fan-out stands. Narrowing must not become a way
  to lose real edges.

  **`--report-unreferenced`** lists callables nothing points at, in
  place of the graph. Not `--dead-code`: it asks a strictly weaker
  question — "does anything point at this?" — and the weakness is the
  feature. Reachability cascades, so one unrooted framework handler
  drags its whole subtree into the report; a reference check cannot,
  because it never looks past one edge. Entries cgg already treats as
  roots are bucketed separately rather than hidden. The case that
  prompted it: two classes documented as the serialization contract
  between two pipeline stages, imported by nothing, found by grep.

  **Unresolved calls are grouped by external module**, largest first,
  in the audit (`unresolved_by_module`) with a one-line stderr summary.
  On one package in the report, 74 unresolved calls mapped almost
  exactly onto a dependency the reader had no access to, and the tally
  quantified the evidence gap — after they grouped it by hand. On
  Netflix's dispatch it reports 27,974 unresolved across 353 modules,
  led by sqlalchemy (3,726) and alembic (1,334).

  **Cost.** Paired medians of five runs at `--jobs 1` against 0.6.5:
  photoprism -0.6%, dispatch +0.7%, ghost +1.8%, netbox +2.0%, flaskbb
  +3.3%. Two rounds of profiling took the grouping from +4.7% to +1.8%
  on the worst case — a quarter-million unresolved calls were each
  scanning their file's whole import list, then each allocating a key —
  by indexing imports once per file and borrowing the keys.

- **Twelve resolver and reporting fixes from a field report** — a
  call-graph audit of a ~200-file Python service (AWS Lambda +
  Powertools + Pydantic). Every one was reproduced against 0.6.5 before
  being fixed, and two reported issues turned out not to need work:
  `--dead-code-report` with `--dead-code-format json` already wrote JSON
  (the repro re-read a stale file), and the Powertools dead-code cascade
  was closed by this release's Lambda rules.

  **Wrong edges** — worse than missing ones, because they read as facts:

  - `super().m()` resolved to the *calling class's own* `m` when the base
    was outside the analyzed tree. Combined with the real forward edge
    this formed a phantom cycle, so a reader tracing control flow
    concluded infinite recursion. `super()` now excludes the calling
    class, and reports `super-base-out-of-graph` when nothing remains.
  - A bare `helper(2)` resolved to a same-file `Holder.helper` **at
    `high`**, outranking the correct `from lib import helper` target at
    `medium`. A bare identifier cannot reach a method in Python, Rust,
    Go, JS/TS or PHP — Ruby, Java and C# are excluded, where it can — and
    an unambiguous import binding is now `high`, because it is not a
    guess.

  **Silently dropped calls**:

  - Duck-typed fan-out above 5 candidates emitted no edges *and no
    record*: indistinguishable from "there is no call here". One method
    with 24 call sites by grep showed 2 inbound edges with no signal that
    22 were dropped. Now recorded as `fanout-cap-exceeded` with the
    candidate count, and the cap is `--fanout-cap`.

  **Resolution that never existed**:

  - **Class instantiation now links to the constructor.** 107
    constructors in the audited service had zero inbound edges out of
    1206 — "who constructs X?" was unanswerable for every Python class.
  - **Inherited methods resolve through the base chain.** `w.apply()`
    produced no edge when `apply` came from a base while `w.extra()` on
    the same receiver resolved, because nothing walked the MRO.
  - **Calling an instance resolves to `__call__`** (`__invoke`, `call`).
    In the audited service this was the single most load-bearing edge in
    the system — the boundary where application code hands control to a
    model — and it was invisible.

  Measured on the benchmark corpus: **+12% edges on netbox, +15% on
  flaskbb**, for no wall-clock cost (medians of five paired runs at
  `--jobs 1` against 0.6.5: dispatch -0.7%, photoprism +0.0%, flaskbb
  +1.6%, netbox +2.0%).

  **Reasons that were factually wrong.** `no-candidate-in-file` was
  reported for names cgg had parsed and indexed — in one case with nine
  candidates — which reads as "this name does not exist". Five specific
  reasons replace it: `fanout-cap-exceeded`, `candidates-in-other-files`
  (with a count), `not-in-scope-for-bare-call`,
  `class-without-explicit-init` and `super-base-out-of-graph`. Where two
  passes record the same site, the specific reason wins.

  **Reporting**:

  - `metrics` in `-t json` was **all zeros** while the graph was fully
    populated. `confidence_histogram` and `unresolved_calls` are exactly
    what a programmatic consumer reads to gauge trust, and zeros suggest
    a clean, fully-resolved graph.
  - `--dead-code-format json` with nowhere to write **exited 0** after
    discarding the report — a silent-failure trap for scripted use. It
    now fails, and `--no-graph` gives the report stdout.
  - `--why-live` rendered definition-side liveness and a real call path
    with the same `LIVE` label. A function only ever *named* in a
    module-level registry now reads `LIVE (root itself — no call path)`.
  - **Pydantic validators are roots.** `@model_validator` /
    `@field_validator` methods are invoked by Pydantic, so a validator
    that provably runs on every construction was reported as dead — and
    dead code cascades, taking everything it calls with it.
  - **`Protocol` / `ABC` stubs are no longer counted as call targets.**
    A body-less declaration was returned as a third implementation
    alongside two real ones, inflating any count of write paths.

- **AWS Lambda entry points, across all six runtimes.** Lambda was the
  largest hole in framework coverage and the one that mattered most:
  nothing in a handler's own file calls it, so before this every Lambda
  codebase reported its entire handler module as dead. Six rules existed
  and five of them enumerated nothing — they only disclosed the gap.

  | runtime | mechanism | shape |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Go | `lambda.Start` and its four variants | B |
  | Java | `handleRequest` on `RequestHandler`/`RequestStreamHandler` | D |
  | Python | `lambda_handler` convention; Powertools routes and `process_partial_response` | A + B |
  | JS / TS | `handler`/`lambdaHandler`, middy, Powertools decorators | A + B |
  | C# | `[LambdaFunction]`, `FunctionHandler` | A |
  | Rust | `service_fn` (already worked) | B |

  Verified against real repositories rather than fixtures alone:
  `powertools-lambda-python` yields 1,282 Powertools entries and 338
  `lambda_handler` entries; `aws-cdk-examples` exercises the TypeScript,
  C#, Java and Go rules at once. All three are now APPS entries.

- **CDK stacks are read as source**, which is the part no convention can
  replace. `_lambda.Function(self, "Api", handler="app.lambda_handler")`
  binds to `lambda_handler` in `app.py` — across files, and whether or
  not the handler's own module imports anything AWS-related. That case
  previously produced no entry by any route.

  This needed two pieces. `decode_string_target` learned the
  `module.function` form every AWS runtime uses (narrowly: the directory
  prefix is stripped only when what remains still carries a dot, so
  `"application/json"` cannot become a claim on a callable named `json`,
  and a filename extension is rejected outright). And the name index
  gained a **file-stem** lookup, because `orders.processOrder` names a
  module, not a type — Python happens to qualify callables that way, but
  JavaScript, TypeScript and Go do not qualify by file at all.

- **`scripts/security-check.sh`** — a pre-publish gate that runs before
  `release.sh`. Eight checks: trufflehog over the working tree *and* git
  history, a direct byte-search for this machine's real tokens in both,
  no credential-shaped files in the repo, `.env` gitignored,
  `cargo-deny` + `npm audit`, no workflow step that could print a secret,
  what `cargo package` and `npm pack` would actually ship, and the
  permissions on local token files.

  Each check was verified to fire by planting the thing it looks for.
  That caught a flaw in the first version: **`--results=verified,unknown`
  finds nothing.** trufflehog only marks a finding `verified` when it can
  authenticate against the live API, so a real credential that has since
  been rotated reports as `unverified` — and three randomly generated
  AWS / GitHub / npm credentials planted in the tree went completely
  undetected. Fixed to `verified,unknown,unverified`, then re-verified.

  The `Lob` detector is excluded because it matches `test_<alnum>`, which
  is every pytest function name in `crates/cgg-py/tests`, and Lob's test
  endpoint accepts any such string — so it reports twelve function names
  as *verified secrets*.

### Changed

- **The registrar-verb gate is now scoped to the file's language.** It
  was the union of every rule in the table, so adding Go's `Start` made
  every Ruby, PHP and Python file pay an argument scan for its own
  `start` calls — a measured +5.6% on `homebox-chi` and +3.6% on
  `photoprism` from the Lambda rules alone. A verb can only ever match a
  rule of its own language, so narrowing loses nothing at match time.

  Paired A/B against 0.6.5 at `--jobs 1`, medians of five warmed runs:
  `homebox-chi` **-3.9%**, `photoprism` **-2.5%**, `netbox` **-1.7%**,
  `ghost` **-1.1%**, `calcom` +0.2% — so the feature lands net faster
  than 0.6.5 rather than merely paying for itself.

  **This changes output on JavaScript and TypeScript trees**, and the
  effect is disclosed rather than buried: string references captured
  under a *foreign* language's verb no longer suppress dead-code
  findings, and inline closures at those call sites are no longer minted
  as `handler_at_N` nodes. Net dead-code findings move by -69 on `ghost`
  and +6 on `calcom`. Go and Python output is byte-identical.

- `release.sh` now gates on the formatters it was missing:
  **`ruff format --check`** (it ran `ruff check` only, and nine files had
  drifted out of format while reporting clean), **markdownlint over all
  22 tracked docs** rather than just README and CHANGELOG, `node --check`
  on the hand-written JavaScript, and a TOML parse of every manifest.
  Extending ruff to `crates/cgg-py/tests/` surfaced 13 real lint errors,
  now fixed — including two `subprocess.run` calls without an explicit
  `check`, both of which genuinely expect a nonzero exit.

  `CLAUDE.md` disables MD013 in-file, with the reason: it is agent-facing
  prose written as long unwrapped paragraphs on purpose. Every other rule
  still applies to it.

### Fixed

- **Multi-argument generics were dropped from every base-type rule.**
  `implements RequestHandler<String, String>` was truncated to
  `RequestHandler<String, String` by a `trim_end_matches` that could not
  tell a generic's `>` from the container's own delimiter, and
  `is_type_name` then rejected it for containing a space. Any rule keyed
  on a multi-argument generic interface silently never fired.

  Not a Lambda-specific bug, and it is how it was found: Java is the one
  runtime where the entry point is a declared contract, so its rule
  should have been the easiest of the six and produced nothing. Measured
  against 0.6.5 on a `IRequestHandler<GetUser, UserDto>` fixture,
  **MediatR** goes from `entries NOT enumerated` to `1 entry`.

- **JS/TS options objects were invisible to registrar capture.**
  `collect_value_refs` descended into `pair` but never into the `object`
  holding the pairs, so every options-bag registration was skipped —
  which is how CDK, and much of the JS ecosystem, passes a handler.

- **Docs claimed a distribution state that three releases had overtaken.**
  All four registries have been on 0.6.5 since the tag, but the prose had
  not caught up, and in two places it steered users away from a working
  install:

  - `README.md` announced "**It is not on npm yet** — `cgg-callgraphgenerator`
    404s on the registry as of 0.6.3" under a heading reading *Node — built,
    not yet published*, and told readers to build from a clone. The package
    has been on npm since v0.6.4. Replaced with the `npm install` line, a
    runnable snippet, and the `optionalDependencies` layout — verified in a
    container: `added 2 packages`, the root plus only `linux-x64-gnu`, and
    the snippet renders a graph.
  - `crates/cgg-py/README.md` and `INSTALL.md` both said the only prebuilt
    wheel was `manylinux_2_17_x86_64` and that macOS, Windows and aarch64
    Linux fall back to a multi-minute source build. Five wheels have
    shipped since 0.6.4. Corrected to the real matrix, with musl Linux and
    Windows-on-arm64 named as what actually reaches the sdist — verified by
    a clean `pip install`, which downloads the 10.1 MB wheel and builds
    nothing.

  `INSTALL.md` also pinned its download URL and `git clone --branch` to
  v0.6.4, and `PUBLISHING.md` still described crates.io as "live at 0.6.3",
  PyPI as one-wheel-per-release, and every GitHub release as `assets=0`.

  None of this is checked by `docs-check.py`: its eleven checks cover
  counts, flags and CHANGELOG structure, but nothing compares a prose claim
  about a registry against that registry.

- **The npm publish step could go green without publishing.**
  `napi prepublish` ships only the per-platform packages; the root
  package — the one users install — needs its own `npm publish`, which
  the workflow never ran. On v0.6.5 that produced five platform packages
  at 0.6.5, a root package still at 0.6.4, and a green job. Caught by
  installing from the registry in a container rather than trusting the
  job status. The workflow now publishes the root and then asserts that
  `npm view` reports the version it just built, failing loudly if not.

  `prepublish` also tries to attach the `.node` files to a GitHub release
  that the workflow already created, which 400s. Those errors are logged
  and swallowed, so a green job proves nothing on its own — hence the
  explicit check.

### Removed

- **`test_results/`** — 63 files, last touched three months before this
  release, regenerated by nothing and linked from no document. It was an
  archive of the original task-by-task build-out (`task01` … `task12`),
  and it had gone from stale to wrong: `task06-stackgraphs-crossfile`
  documents a working "stack-graphs integration", while
  `stack_graphs_resolver.rs` has been a 46-line no-op stub since the
  tree-sitter 0.26 upgrade and CLAUDE.md tells agents not to assume it
  resolves anything. It also cited cgg 0.1.0 and tree-sitter 0.23/0.24.

  cgg's primary reader is a coding agent scanning the repo, so a
  contradicted claim in a plausible-looking directory is worse than no
  directory. It shipped in no artifact — zero files in any crate package
  or the sdist — so nothing users install changes. `git show
  v0.6.5:test_results/...` still has it.

### Fixed

- **The graph depended on filesystem enumeration order.** `cgg-walk` used
  `WalkBuilder::build()` with no sort, so it yielded readdir order — which
  differs between machines for byte-identical trees. Node ids are
  positional, so the same commit produced different `C0`/`C1`/… ids and a
  different declaration order on each machine, making the mermaid output
  non-diffable across a team and undercutting both "deterministic" and
  "diffable in a PR".

  Found by installing 0.6.4 through all five distribution channels in five
  containers and diffing the output of one fixture: **three distinct
  graphs**. The enumeration orders were genuinely different
  (`lib.rs app.py mod.go app.js` / `app.js mod.go app.py lib.rs` /
  `lib.rs mod.go app.py app.js`) and the graphs tracked them exactly.

  The `--jobs` determinism test could not catch this: it varies thread
  count against one directory on one host, where readdir order is a
  constant. Fixed with `sort_by_file_path`, covered by a new test that
  asserts sorted order directly, and verified by re-running the same
  binary in all three containers — one identical graph.

  **This changes node ids and node order for any tree the filesystem did
  not already enumerate in sorted order.** Edges and semantics are
  unaffected.

- The release tarballs shipped `libcgg.d` (a make-style dep-info file) and
  `libcgg.rlib` (the Rust lib target's archive, unusable from C), because
  the packaging step globbed `libcgg.*`. Now copies explicit extensions.

### Added

- `INSTALL.md` — the minimum packages each distribution channel actually
  needs, established by installing into bare `ubuntu:24.04` containers and
  adding only what each channel refused to work without. Notable findings:
  Ubuntu's Rust (1.75) cannot build cgg (needs 1.85), a C compiler is
  required even though cgg is a Rust program, and `python3-venv` is
  mandatory on 24.04 because the system Python is PEP 668 managed.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-08-12

Documentation correctness pass. No behaviour change; the code fixes below
are to comments that ship inside published artifacts.

### Fixed

- **PyPI 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 shipped without an sdist**, so `pip install` on
  macOS, Windows and aarch64 Linux failed outright with "no matching
  distribution" — there was no source fallback to build from.
  `scripts/publish-python.sh` only ever built the wheel. It now builds,
  `twine check`s and uploads an sdist alongside every wheel, and the
  missing 0.6.3 sdist was uploaded (verified by forcing a source install
  from PyPI with `--no-binary :all:`).

- **`crates/cgg-node` doc comments were wrong, and they ship to npm.**
  `index.d.ts` is generated from them, so the types users read in their
  editor claimed `toJson()` was "byte-identical to `cgg -t json`" (it
  embeds per-run `parse_ms`/`wall_ms`; mermaid, dot and graphml *are*
  byte-identical) and that the analysis runs on "libuv's thread pool"
  (it is `spawn_blocking` on tokio's, via napi's `tokio_rt`). Both
  corrected at the source and the stubs regenerated.

- **The C example in `crates/cgg-ffi/README.md` did not compile** —
  missing `<stdio.h>`, so `NULL`, `stderr`, `fputs` and `puts` were all
  undeclared. It now builds clean under `-Wall -Wextra`.

- **`CHANGELOG.md` had lost the whole `[0.6.2]` entry** while 0.6.2 was
  live on two registries: an edit adding 0.6.3 replaced the header
  instead of inserting before it, so 0.6.2's content sat under the
  0.6.3 heading. Restored, and `docs-check` check 10 now fails on a
  skipped patch version.

### Documentation

Every factual claim in every markdown file was re-verified against a
command rather than accepted. The corrections that mattered most:

- **A pipeline stage that does not exist.** README documented
  "Stack-graphs resolution" as step 3 of the resolution pipeline;
  descriptor linking was missing entirely.
- **Verification commands that silently prove the wrong thing.** The
  `push` and `docs-sync` skills told an agent to check plugin counts
  with `rg -c 'plugin\.register'` (returns nothing — the calls are
  `reg.register(`, so it "proves" zero plugins), to find
  `trait_impl_target` in `main.rs` (it is in `lib.rs`, so it "proves"
  dynamic dispatch was removed), and used `rg -E` as extended-regex
  (it is `--encoding`, and errors). A verification procedure whose
  commands lie is worse than none.
- **Self-contradictions in `cgg-frameworks`**: bucket A pointed at
  `root_attributes`, which is not a `FrameworkRule` field; "`detect` is
  the gate" was disproven in both directions by live test; "route paths
  are not captured" (they are — the gap is the HTTP verb); "there is no
  `base = …` matcher" while the same doc documented `base_types`.
- **Counts and measurements**: 178 → **211** dependency packages; six →
  **seven** C ABI functions; seven → **eight** trust-boundary kinds
  (`public` was missing); 40 → **44** grammars; `--jobs 32` is 1.4× on
  pandoc, not "roughly twice as fast"; NetBox is ~3.0 s, not 6.8 s; and
  the Python concurrency and speedup figures were re-measured.
- **Unprovable claims deleted**, notably "the highest-confidence band is
  roughly 20-45% precise", which has no provenance anywhere in the repo
  and cannot be established without manually reviewing every finding.

`docs-check` gains check 10 (CHANGELOG integrity) and its docstring's
stale "Seven checks" is now eleven.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-12

> Published to crates.io and PyPI. **Not tagged**, and not on npm — the
> npm packages publish from a `v0.6.3` tag, which has not been pushed.

### Added

- **Node.js bindings**, `crates/cgg-node`. The package builds on all five
  platforms in CI but is **not published to npm yet** — `npm install
  cgg-callgraphgenerator` does not work until a `v*` tag runs the publish
  job. Build it locally with `napi build --platform --release`.

  ```js
  const cgg = require("cgg-callgraphgenerator");
  const g = await cgg.analyze("./src");
  console.log(g.toMermaid());
  ```

  `crates/cgg-node` is an N-API module over `cgg::analyze`, a translation
  layer with no analysis logic — the same contract `cgg-py` and `cgg-ffi`
  hold. `analyze` is async and runs on libuv's pool so a server does not
  stall its event loop; `analyzeSync` is there for scripts. TypeScript
  definitions are generated from the Rust, so they cannot drift.

  Shapes mirror the Python module field for field — `Edge` is
  `src`/`dst`/`siteLine`/`siteByte`/`confidence`/`via` — because two
  bindings over one pipeline should not describe the same graph with
  different words. Same single rename from the CLI: `entryNodes: true`.

  15 tests, including byte-identical parity with the binary across all
  four formats and seven option combinations, with a guard that fails if
  no option changed the graph — otherwise parity could pass while the
  module ignored every keyword it was given.

  **Native, not a wrapper over the C ABI.** npm needs a per-platform
  artifact either way, so the C ABI would buy nothing here while costing
  an FFI dependency and a slower boundary.

  **Packaged the way npm does native modules**: one package per platform,
  listed as `optionalDependencies`, so npm installs only the one matching
  the host. That needs no install script, which matters more than it
  looks — `npm ci --ignore-scripts` is common in CI and in
  security-conscious orgs, and a source-build `postinstall` silently
  produces a broken install under it. A source package was considered and
  rejected for that reason: it also needs a Rust toolchain, ~53 s of
  compilation, and leaves 779 MB of build artifacts. npm has no `sdist`
  equivalent to fall back on the way PyPI does.

  Naming: `cgg` is taken on npm (an unrelated ChampionGG API wrapper), so
  the package matches PyPI rather than inventing a third spelling.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` gains a five-target Node matrix, and the
  publish job now pushes to npm as well as PyPI.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-11

> Published to crates.io and PyPI. Not tagged.

### Fixed

- **The PyPI page told people to `pip install cgg` — the wrong project.**
  0.6.1's wheel embedded a stale README: it was edited while the maturin
  build was already running, so maturin had read the previous text. The
  repository was correct the whole time; only the published artifact was
  wrong. PyPI metadata cannot be edited after upload, which is why this
  costs a version rather than a re-upload.

  `scripts/publish-python.sh` now compares the wheel's embedded
  description against `crates/cgg-py/README.md` and refuses to upload on
  a mismatch — catching both that race and a plainly forgotten rebuild.
  Verified to fire on the 0.6.1 wheel.

### Performance — the "0.6.0 regression" was one atypical repository

**There is no corpus-wide regression.** Paired A/B over 29 repositories,
both binaries run back to back within each trial:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| median per-repo delta | **+0.0%** |
| total wall across all 29 | +2.7% |
| within ±5% | 18 of 29 |
| **faster** | **10 of 29** |
| worse than +10% | 2 |

Only `c-jq` regresses in every paired trial. Its magnitude is unstable
between sessions (+23% to +45%), and `cpp-nlohmann-json`, which looked
like a second case at +9.5% in one run, came back +0.0% in another — it
was noise.

**Where the earlier "+4-6.8%" came from.** `scripts/perf-compare.sh` uses
a fixed 9-repo set that contains `c-jq`, so one anomalous repository
carried a ninth of the weight of the headline number. Two earlier entries
in this file reported that as a real, corpus-wide regression. It was not.

**It is not the C grammar.** No tree-sitter crate changed between v0.5.0
and now — 44 of them, all identical versions; the 0.26 upgrade predates
0.5.0 and is inside both binaries. And `c-redis` is 13 MB of C across 950
files and is unaffected (−1.6%).

**What makes `c-jq` different is its shape, not its language:**

| repo | analyzed files | biggest file | top 8 files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| c-jq | 69 | 22% of bytes | 63% |
| c-redis | 950 | 5.1% | 20.7% |
| cpp-spdlog | 157 | 14.2% | 48.3% |

69 work items across 8 workers, one of them a fifth of the total work, so
wall time is the critical path of a single file. That is long-tail load
imbalance, and it amplifies any change in how work is scheduled. The
0.6.x per-call pool does schedule slightly differently — `install` runs
the driver on a pool worker where 0.5.0 drove from the main thread — but
on any tree without that skew the difference does not survive the noise.

**Consequence: this is not worth optimising the pipeline for.** The thing
to fix, if anything, is the load imbalance itself — splitting or ordering
large files so one item cannot dominate a phase — which would help every
skewed repository rather than reverting a change that exists to make
`--jobs` work on the second call.

Recorded because it was diagnosed wrongly twice: first blamed on the
`ExtractCtx` threading, then correctly narrowed to the pool but wrongly
reported as corpus-wide. Both earlier claims came from measuring one
repository, or a repo set weighted towards it.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-11

**First release published to crates.io.** `cargo install cgg` works, and
`cgg` is usable as a library dependency. 0.6.0 shipped only as a git tag.

### Packaging

- **Published to PyPI as `cgg-callgraphgenerator`** — `pip install
  cgg-callgraphgenerator`, then `import cgg`. PyPI's `cgg` belongs to an
  unrelated GGUF tool with 49 releases, so the short name was never
  available; the long form spells out what CGG stands for. That package
  also ships a top-level `cgg` module, so **the two must not share an
  environment** — both write to `site-packages/cgg/` and pip will not stop
  you. Documented in both READMEs.

  The wheel is `manylinux_2_17` + `abi3-cp39`: built in maturin's CentOS 7
  container, because PyPI rejects plain `linux_x86_64` wheels and a wheel
  built on a modern box links a glibc newer than most users have. One
  wheel covers every CPython from 3.9 up. 10.1 MB.
  `scripts/publish-python.sh` does the build, the clean-venv test and the
  upload.

- All six library/binary crates now carry the metadata a registry listing
  needs — `repository`, `homepage`, `keywords`, `categories`,
  `rust-version` — inherited from the workspace so the listing cannot
  drift from it, plus a per-crate `README.md`. The root README lives
  outside every package directory, so without one each crates.io page
  would have rendered blank.
- The five internal library crates say so on their own front page: they
  are published only so `cgg` can depend on them by version, and their
  APIs change freely between minors to serve that one consumer.
- `cgg-py` and `cgg-ffi` stay `publish = false`. The artifact anyone
  wants from those is a wheel and a shared library, not a crate.

### Added

- **`crates/cgg-ffi` — a C ABI.** One shared library (`libcgg.so`) or
  static archive (`libcgg.a`) serves C, .NET, Java, Go, Ruby and anything
  else with an FFI, so a binding is source rather than another native
  artifact per language per platform.

  Seven functions. Options cross as a JSON document and results as strings,
  which is the load-bearing decision: adding a cgg flag adds a JSON key,
  not an entry point, so **the ABI does not change when cgg gains a
  feature** and no wrapper needs rebuilding. It is affordable because
  rendering is nearly free next to analysis — 6.5 ms for `to_json()` and
  1.3 ms for `to_mermaid()` against 137.7 ms of analysis on cgg's own
  tree. `cgg_analyze` returns an opaque handle rather than a rendered
  string, so mermaid *and* JSON *and* the metrics cost one analysis.

  Output is byte-identical to the CLI across all four formats, asserted by
  test. Statically linked, a C program depends on nothing but libc and
  libgcc — the CLI's self-contained promise survives the boundary.

  Unknown option keys are an error rather than ignored: C callers
  hand-write the JSON, so a silently-dropped `"hopz"` is the failure this
  boundary is most exposed to.

- **The Rust library needs only one dependency now.** `cgg` re-exports
  `OutputFormat`, `Result`/`Error` and the graph types, so a consumer no
  longer has to name `cgg-format` and `anyhow` in its own manifest just to
  call the API — which also stopped their versions from drifting from the
  ones cgg was built against.

- `RunOptions` derives `Serialize`/`Deserialize`, with `#[serde(default,
  deny_unknown_fields)]`, which is what the JSON options boundary is built
  on.

### Fixed

- **`cgg::analyze` no longer leaks memory per call.** 0.6.0 leaked ~161
  bytes every time it was called. `cgg_resolve::type_hints` had a
  `leak_str` helper that `Box::leak`ed a copy of every parameter name and
  type, with a comment calling that "acceptable because we're in a
  short-lived analysis pass" — true while the pipeline was private to a
  binary that analyzed once and exited, and false the moment 0.6.0 made it
  a library, a Python module and a C ABI callable in a loop. A host
  process analyzing on a loop grew without bound.

  The leak existed only to dodge a borrow conflict: the strings are slices
  of `def.signature_hint`, and `facts` is mutably borrowed later in the
  same function. They now go into an owned `Vec` that the function drops.
  **The allocation count is unchanged** — the leaked version called
  `to_string()` too — so this costs nothing; the strings are simply freed.

  Verified under valgrind: 0 bytes definitely lost on `cgg-walk`,
  `cgg-format`, a single 467-line file and all of `./crates`, where 0.6.0
  lost 161 bytes in 28 blocks. Graph output is byte-identical on
  `./crates`, `c-jq`, `go-fzf` and `python-flask`, and still deterministic
  across `--jobs` 1–32.

  Diagnosis note, because it is the reason 0.6.0 shipped with this:
  **`mimalloc` hides leaks from valgrind entirely.** With the global
  allocator in place valgrind reported no leak summary at all; the 161
  bytes only appeared once it was removed. The CLI was never affected — it
  analyzes once and exits.

- `docs-check.py` check 9: `Box::leak`, `.leak()` and `mem::forget` in the
  pipeline crates must be listed in `ALLOWED_LEAKS` with a reason. A leak
  justified by "the process is about to exit" has to be re-checked when
  that stops being true, and nothing was re-checking. The one remaining
  entry is `profile.rs`, which is bounded by `&'static str` span literals
  and compiled out of release builds.

### Performance

Flat. `scripts/perf-compare.sh` against the previous commit, median of 7
over the standard 9-repo set: **2258 ms → 2260 ms, +0.1%** — far inside
the ~1–1.5% noise floor. Expected: the leak fix changes where the strings
are freed, not how many are allocated.

The "+4–6.8% regression" reported against 0.5.0 was later re-measured
across 29 repositories and is **not corpus-wide** — median per-repo delta
is +0.0% and 10 of 29 are faster. See the 0.6.2 entry.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-11

The pipeline is a library, and there is a Python module on top of it.

```python
import cgg
g = cgg.analyze("./src")
print(g.to_mermaid())
```

The 1,035-line `run()` inside `main.rs` was private to a bin-only crate,
so nothing outside the binary could invoke it. `crates/cgg` now has a
`[lib]` target alongside its `[[bin]]`, and `crates/cgg-py` is a PyO3
extension module over it. Both front ends call `cgg::analyze`, so the
resolver ordering that CLAUDE.md calls load-bearing exists in exactly one
place.

**The CLI is unchanged.** Graph output is byte-identical to 0.5.0 across
all four formats, and so is the stdout/stderr interleaving, the exit
codes, and every advisory's `-q` gating. The binary links no libpython
and grew 48 KB.

### Added

- `cgg::analyze(&RunOptions) -> RunOutcome`, performing no I/O beyond
  reading source — no writes, no stdout/stderr, no `process::exit`.
  Everything a run writes comes back as an ordered `Vec<Emission>`.
- `crates/cgg-py`: `import cgg`. Every option that changes the graph is a
  keyword argument, with one rename — `entry_nodes=True` rather than
  `--no-entry-nodes`, same default. Four renderers, `.callables`,
  `.edges`, `.files`, `.metrics`, `.notices`, `.jobs`, `to_dict()`,
  `callable()`, `callers_of()`, `callees_of()`. `abi3-py39`, so one wheel
  per platform serves every CPython >= 3.9. Build with
  `scripts/build-python.sh`.
- `docs-check.py` checks 7 and 8: the self-analysis showcase filter must
  agree across every file that names it and must still produce a graph
  spanning three or more crates, and every `RunOptions` field must be
  reachable from `cgg-py` or listed as deliberately deferred.

### Fixed

Three bugs that a binary running one analysis per process could not
reach, and a second caller can:

- **`--jobs` was ignored after the first analysis in a process.**
  `build_global()`'s error was dropped with `let _ =`, and the global
  pool can only be set once, so later calls silently reused the first
  call's thread count. Now a per-call pool entered with
  `ThreadPool::install`, with `RunOutcome::jobs` reporting
  `rayon::current_num_threads()` read inside it.
- **One project's framework rules suppressed the next project's.**
  `set_extra_registrar_verbs` wrote to a `OnceLock` where only the first
  call took effect, so the second project analyzed in a process could
  lose its entry points. The switch now travels in a per-run
  `cgg_lang::ExtractCtx`; `DEADCODE_SIGNALS`, `EXTRA_REGISTRAR_VERBS` and
  `HAS_EXTRA_VERBS` are gone.
- **`--write-roots` called `std::process::exit(0)` inside the pipeline.**
  Harmless in a binary; linked into CPython it would terminate the
  interpreter with no traceback. It returns the baseline now.

### Performance

**cgg is roughly 4–5% slower on the standard 9-repo comparison set.**
Measured with `scripts/perf-compare.sh` against 0.5.0, median of 7:

| repo | 0.5.0 | unreleased | delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 236 ms | 238 ms | +0.8% |
| python-flask | 129 ms | 130 ms | +0.8% |
| js-express | 83 ms | 83 ms | +0.0% |
| go-fzf | 219 ms | 226 ms | +3.2% |
| c-jq | 145 ms | 182 ms | +25.5% |
| cpp-spdlog | 308 ms | 308 ms | +0.0% |
| csharp-serilog | 115 ms | 120 ms | +4.3% |
| swift-alamofire | 238 ms | 242 ms | +1.7% |
| cpp-nlohmann-json | 724 ms | 756 ms | +4.4% |
| **TOTAL** | **2197 ms** | **2285 ms** | **+4.0%** |

Three runs of the full set gave totals of **+4.0%, +5.5% and +6.8%**, with
`c-jq` at +25.5%, +21.5% and +25.9%. The direction is reproducible and
well above the ~1–1.5% noise floor, so this is a real regression, not
jitter. The spread tracks machine load, which was 1.0–2.8 across the
three runs — `perf-compare.sh` warns that a loaded machine invalidates
the comparison, so treat +4% as the floor and re-run on an idle box
before tagging.

The graph is byte-identical to 0.5.0 on every repo in the table, so the
cost buys nothing in output — it is the price of the correctness fixes
above. `parse` CPU rises ~7% while wall time rises more, so the loss is mostly
parallel efficiency rather than extra work.

> **This entry is wrong twice over.** It blamed the `ExtractCtx`
> threading, and it reported a corpus-wide regression. Neither holds: a
> 29-repository paired comparison puts the median per-repo delta at
> +0.0%, with 10 repositories faster, and the only consistently slower
> one is `c-jq` — whose file-size skew makes it uniquely sensitive to
> scheduling. The table below is a 9-repo set containing it. See the
> 0.6.2 entry.

**Recovering this is open follow-up work.** It is a deliberate trade for
now: the globals it replaced made a second analysis in one process return
wrong answers, and correctness at 4% is a better default than speed that
silently lies.

### Compatibility

**No change to the CLI.** Every flag, every output format, every exit
code and the stdout/stderr interleaving are what 0.5.0 produced, verified
byte-for-byte on `./crates` and on the 9-repo comparison corpus. The
default graph does not grow: this release adds no resolver and no rule.

**`cgg-lang` has a breaking API change.** `LanguagePlugin::extract` takes
`&ExtractCtx` as its first argument, and `set_deadcode_signals`,
`deadcode_signals`, `set_extra_registrar_verbs` and `is_registrar_verb`
are gone from the crate root — `ExtractCtx::is_registrar_verb` replaces
the last. All 44 in-tree plugins are updated. An out-of-tree plugin must
add the parameter; `ExtractCtx::plain()` is the no-switches context that
plugin tests use.

**The Rust library API is new, and pre-1.0.** `cgg::analyze`,
`RunOptions`, `RunOutcome`, `Emission` and `cgg::emit` are public as of
this release and may change in any 0.x minor — `RunOptions` in
particular gains a field whenever a graph-affecting flag is added, and it
is deliberately *not* `#[non_exhaustive]`, because `From<&Cli>`
destructures it with no `..` rest so that a new flag fails to compile
until it is routed. Pin an exact minor if you depend on it.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-07

Two releases in one. The framework rule table went from 51 rules to 394
across 36 languages, and then the tool was taught to use the machine it
runs on. **Whole-corpus latency fell from 3,202s to 205s.**

### Performance

0.4.2 → 0.5.0, measured on the **shipped default worker count** — which
is what you actually get, not a tuned best case:

| repo | 0.4.2 | 0.5.0 default | 0.5.0 `--jobs 32` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| app-druid-jaxrs | 143.7 s | **18.6 s** (7.7×) | 8.0 s (18×) |
| c-redis | 41.4 s | **7.9 s** (5.2×) | 2.6 s (15.7×) |
| rust-ripgrep | 0.53 s | **0.27 s** (2.0×) | 0.40 s |
| app-django-netbox | 4.07 s | **3.58 s** | 3.74 s |
| python-flask | 0.18 s | **0.13 s** | 0.16 s |

**Two numbers, on purpose.** The default is deliberately conservative —
half the physical cores, capped at 8 — so cgg is a good guest on a shared
host. On a large tree more workers genuinely help, and `--jobs 32`
roughly doubles the default again. Small repositories are *faster* at
the default, where thread-spawn cost dominates.

The corpus-wide figure below was measured before that cap existed, at one
worker per logical CPU. It is the ceiling the parallelism reaches, not
what an untuned run produces:

**Whole corpus: 3,202 s → 205 s (−93.6%)** over 103 repositories, 100 of
them comparable. 73 of 100 repositories are more than 5% faster. **None
is more than 10% slower in absolute terms** — the 9 that show a
percentage regression are
all sub-200ms runs where a few milliseconds of process startup dominates.

**`zig-zig` could not be analysed at all before this release.** It
exceeded a 1,800-second timeout on 0.4.2 and now completes in 498s,
producing 344,807 callables. That is a capability change, not a speed
one, and it is why the raw corpus node and finding totals jump: excluding
that one repository, nodes move +8,107 and dead-code findings move
**−9,146**. `dart-flutter` and `erlang-otp` still exceed 1,800s on both
releases and are excluded from every total here.

Reproduce with `scripts/compare-release.py OLD_BIN NEW_BIN`. Note that
`--jobs 1` is the setting for numbers being published; the default runs
repositories concurrently, which is sound for an A/B delta but not for an
absolute latency claim.

### Parallelism

cgg parallelised exactly one phase before this release — the per-file
parse loop — and everything after it ran on one core. On Druid that was
110% CPU on a 64-core machine for 150 seconds.

Five phases now run in parallel, each verified to produce a
**byte-identical graph** at any thread count:

- **Cross-file resolution.** The single biggest win, and the reason Druid
  went from 150s to 8s. A 637-line per-file loop that read shared indexes
  and wrote only its own output.
- **Intra-file linking and type propagation.** Per-file and independent.
- **Framework matching**, fanned out across rules once the per-language
  indexes are hoisted out of the loop.
- **Audit serialisation** — 569ms of a Druid run spent on one core
  serialising JSON. Output is byte-identical to `to_writer_pretty`.

**The allocator was the ceiling.** Thread scaling stopped paying after
four cores, and the profiler showed why: the *same work* cost 6.8s of CPU
at `--jobs 4` and 10.6s at `--jobs 64` — 56% more CPU to produce
identical output. That is the system allocator serialising under
extraction's load, which allocates a `String` per name, per reference,
per qualified path, on every worker at once. **cgg now uses `mimalloc`
as its global allocator**; on its own that took Druid from 138s to 106s.

Two ordinary inefficiencies turned up in the same pass and are worth
naming because neither needed parallelism to fix: `known_refs` was
rebuilt **once per file** from identical data (1,273 files × ~10,000
names on netbox), and each file's audit record was located by linear
scan, making that step O(files²).

### Added: `--profile`

`RunMetrics::phases` records four coarse buckets. That stopped being
enough once "link" grew a type propagator, a cross-file resolver, an FFI
linker, a descriptor linker, a framework engine with six matchers and a
dead-code pass — a 25% regression inside that bucket is invisible from
outside it.

`--profile` prints a per-span breakdown. It is **compiled out of release
builds**: `span()` is `#[cfg]`-reduced to a constant `None`, so there is
no atomic load, no clock read and no branch to argue about. The numbers
this project publishes are measured on release binaries, and a profiler
that *could* perturb them is a profiler that makes those numbers
arguable. Debug builds collect by default. For release-speed numbers with
attribution, build with `RUSTFLAGS="-C debug-assertions=on"`.

Spans accumulate into per-thread-cached atomics rather than a locked map.
The first version used a global mutex and reported 263% CPU on a run the
plain binary did at 212% — it was measuring the contention it caused.

### Framework coverage: 45 → 343 frameworks, 12 → 36 languages

The rule table went from 51 to 394 `(id, language)` rules.

**The failure this fixes is silence.** An unrecognised framework
previously produced *no coverage line at all* — a real aiohttp app with
two routes reported `recognised (none)` and `seen, no rules (none)`, so
the disclosure pointed the reader at an empty list. Most of the new rules
are deliberately **detect-only**: they enumerate nothing and carry a
`gap` string naming the concrete construct to inspect by hand. A rule
that enumerates badly is worse than one that declines and says why.

Six detection gaps that were defects are closed, each traced to a
specific real-world idiom:

| framework | what was missed |
| --- | --- |
| `actix-actor` | `rust.rs` never populated `base_types`, so no base-type rule could fire on Rust at all |
| `chi` | handlers wrapped in `chain.ToHandlerFunc(...)` |
| `sinatra` | `get "/x" do … end` — Ruby hangs the block off the call's `block` field, never the argument list |
| `worker-threads` | worker modules that identify *themselves* rather than being named at a literal spawn path |
| `spring-messaging` | Spring AMQP puts `@RabbitListener` on the class and `@RabbitHandler` on the method |
| `nestjs-schedule` | nothing — the rule was correct; the corpus app scheduled via `SchedulerRegistry` |

New trust boundaries: **`TrustKind::Public`** for Solidity, where the
language *is* the framework — every `public`/`external` function is
callable by any address on the chain. 1,495 entries on OpenZeppelin, and
dead-code false positives there fell 37%. **`TrustKind::Ffi`** is now
produced, for `#[no_mangle]`/PyO3/wasm-bindgen exports.

**Descriptor → implementation linking** (`Via::Descriptor`). cgg parses
`.proto` and the languages that implement it, so it can now link
`service Greeter { rpc SayHello }` to the Go method serving it — an edge
neither file references. `.proto` rpcs became callables to make this
possible. The match requires the implementing type to *name the service*:
method name alone matches `Get` everywhere, and a missing edge is a gap
while a wrong edge is a lie about where control goes.

### Fixed: two nondeterminism defects, one of them shipped in 0.4.2

> **Read this section even if you skip the rest.** cgg's central claim is
> that the same input yields the same graph. Two code paths broke that,
> and **one of them is in the released 0.4.2 binary**. Neither produced a
> wrong edge *set* — only a varying edge or node *order* — which is
> precisely why they survived: a spot check passes, and only a byte-diff
> of two runs shows it.

- **`--dead-code` produced a different graph on every run, on any
  codebase with traits.** `--dead-code` force-enables
  `--dynamic-dispatch`, and `dispatch::fanout` iterated a `HashMap` to
  emit its declaration→implementation edges. Rust's `RandomState`
  reseeds per process, so the fan-out edges came out in a different order
  each time. Four runs over cgg's own source produced four different
  graphs. **This is present in 0.4.2 and every release that had
  `--dynamic-dispatch`.** If you diffed dead-code output between runs and
  saw churn, this was why. Fixed by sorting the keys.
- **`-n 0 --max-paths N` produced a different graph on every run when the
  cap truncated.** Entry points were walked in `HashMap` order, so *which*
  paths survived the cap varied. Node counts swung 7–9 across four runs of
  the same command. Without truncation the result was identical either
  way, which is why it hid. Fixed by sorting the entry set.

Both are now covered by `crates/cgg/tests/determinism.rs`, and both tests
were verified to *fail* against the unfixed code — a regression test that
has never seen the bug it guards is a guess.

**The determinism test that shipped alongside the parallelism work did
not catch either of these**, because its fixture had no trait with
multiple implementations and never triggered path truncation. That is the
more useful lesson than the bugs themselves: a green determinism suite is
only evidence for the shapes it actually exercises.

### Fixed: four plugin bugs that silently disabled whole languages

> **Read this section.** Each of these made a language's framework
> detection impossible, with no error and no warning — the coverage table
> simply reported nothing and looked correct doing it.

- **Lua recorded every `require` as the literal string `"("`.**
  `arguments.child(0)` returns the `(` token; it needed `named_child(0)`.
  Kong now detects across 744 files where it previously detected none,
  and Lua cross-file resolution gains real edges.
- **C and C++ ignored system includes entirely.** Only quoted includes
  were recorded, so `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` produced nothing and no
  C/C++ rule keyed on a system header could fire. System includes are now
  recorded under a distinct `system-include` kind, so the cross-file
  resolver still correctly ignores them.
- **Erlang recorded only `-import(...)`.** `-behaviour(gen_server)` — the
  only way Erlang declares an OTP contract — was invisible.
- **`FrameworkRule::has_matchers()` omitted `methods`.** Any methods-only
  rule (the structural-typing escape hatch that exists precisely for Go
  interfaces and Elixir OTP behaviours) filed itself under "seen, no
  rules" no matter how many entries it minted — a rule reporting a gap it
  did not have. Elixir went 0 → 359 entries on a real Phoenix app.

Registrar capture was added to the Elixir, Perl and Clojure plugins,
which had none: Phoenix's router now enumerates 151 routes on Plausible,
and Mojolicious 283 on its own tree. Lua was assessed and deliberately
**not** changed — its two rules are declared-gap rules, so capture there
would have had no consumer.

### Added: verification that the table cannot rot

- **`tests/detect_prefixes.rs`** synthesises, for every rule, a file
  importing that rule's own first `detect` prefix, and asserts the rule
  fires. A rule whose prefix does not match how the language actually
  writes that import is worse than no rule, because the coverage table
  then implies the framework was considered and found absent. This test
  found the Lua, C/C++ and Erlang bugs above.
- **`tests/determinism.rs`** asserts the graph is identical at 1, 2, 8
  and 32 threads. It compares *structure*, not bytes: the JSON and audit
  documents embed per-run timings, so a naive hash comparison reports
  nondeterminism that is not there.
- **`scripts/sync-app-manifest.py`** derives the corpus manifest from
  measurement rather than by hand, and **`APPS_UNVERIFIED`** in
  `benchmark.sh` states out loud which rules no real application
  exercises, with a reason each.

### Changed

#### Dependency disclosure: `mimalloc`

**cgg takes a new dependency in this release** — the first since
`b2afced` removed the update check and every network dependency. Stated
plainly because a dependency added for speed is still a dependency:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| crate | `mimalloc` 0.1.52 → `libmimalloc-sys` 0.1.49 |
| licence | **MIT** (both), already on `deny.toml`'s permissive allow-list |
| what it is | Microsoft's general-purpose allocator, set as cgg's `#[global_allocator]` |
| ships C | yes — `libmimalloc-sys` bundles mimalloc's C source and compiles it at build time via `cc` |
| new transitive deps | none. `cc` 1.2.62 was already in `Cargo.lock` |
| generation | **mimalloc v3.3.2** — upstream's recommended line, not the v2 "stable" line. Selected by leaving the `v2` feature off; every number above was measured on v3. Take `features = ["v2"]` for the conservative choice |
| features | none. `override` is **off**, which matters: mimalloc serves only Rust's `Global`, so the 44 tree-sitter C parsers that handle untrusted input keep glibc's hardened allocator |

**It does not change cgg's build requirements.** 45 crates in the graph
already required `cc` — every tree-sitter grammar, plus
`crates/cgg-lang/build.rs` compiling a vendored `parser.c` for the Smithy
grammar — and `skills/cgg-install/SKILL.md` already documents the C
toolchain check. A from-source install without a C compiler was already
broken before 0.5.0. Cost measured: +4.3s on a clean release build, and a
416 KB static library. Nothing changes at runtime; cgg still makes no
network requests.

**One advisory exists and does not apply.** RUSTSEC-2022-0094
(`unsound`, bad alignment) is patched in mimalloc >= 0.1.39; the pin is
0.1.52. `cargo deny check` passes all four checks — advisories, bans,
licenses, sources.

What it buys: thread scaling stopped paying past four cores because the
system allocator serialised under extraction's allocation load. mimalloc
alone took Druid from 138s to 106s, and is a substantial part of the
overall 15× speedup.

If you would rather not ship it, removing the `#[global_allocator]`
attribute in `crates/cgg/src/main.rs` and the two `Cargo.toml` entries
restores the previous allocator; everything else in this release stands
without it.

#### Other changes

- `--profile` is a new flag (see above).
- `scripts/compare-release.py` and `scripts/sync-app-manifest.py` are new
  release tooling.

### Compatibility

The default graph grows, as it only ever does: +8,107 nodes and +20,581
edges across the corpus, excluding the repository that previously timed
out. Dead-code findings *fall* by 9,146 — the new entry points give
previously-unreferenced handlers a caller.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-06

One real application per framework, and every detection gap that was a
defect closed. 0.4.1 checked the documentation against the code; this
release checks the *framework rules* against real applications, which
found six gaps and two counting bugs that no fixture had exercised.

### Performance

0.4.1 → 0.4.2: latency **flat**.

Measured against **0.4.0**, not 0.4.1 — 0.4.1 was never committed
separately, so it is not a ref that can be checked out and built. 0.4.1
was itself flat against 0.4.0, so the 0.4.1 → 0.4.2 delta is flat too.
Two full runs, because a single run's per-repo numbers did not reproduce:

| repo | 0.4.0 | 0.4.2 run 1 | 0.4.2 run 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 429 / 421 ms | 430 ms | 426 ms |
| python-flask | 158 / 161 ms | 166 ms | 162 ms |
| js-express | 107 / 100 ms | 99 ms | 101 ms |
| go-fzf | 273 / 274 ms | 291 ms | 283 ms |
| c-jq | 155 / 149 ms | 149 ms | 152 ms |
| cpp-spdlog | 308 / 303 ms | 305 ms | 318 ms |
| csharp-serilog | 137 / 136 ms | 140 ms | 139 ms |
| swift-alamofire | 420 / 427 ms | 429 ms | 427 ms |
| cpp-nlohmann-json | 943 / 939 ms | 908 ms | 920 ms |
| **TOTAL** | **2,930 / 2,910 ms** | **2,917 ms (−0.4%)** | **2,928 ms (+0.6%)** |

**−0.4% and +0.6% — a 1.0% spread against a 1.0–1.5% noise floor, so
flat.** Per-repo deltas are *not* reported as real: they did not
reproduce between runs. `cpp-spdlog` swung −1.0% → +5.0% and `go-fzf`
+6.6% → +3.3%, on code paths this release does not touch. Two baseline
columns are shown for the same reason — the baseline binary itself
measured 2,930 ms and 2,910 ms on identical code.

Graph output on the same 9-repo set, 0.4.0 → 0.4.2, one methodology
(whole repo, default mode; `dead` from `--dead-code`, high-confidence
plus withheld):

| repo | nodes | edges | entry | dead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 2,906 | 7,100 | 0 | 1,429 |
| python-flask | 1,698→1,732 | 1,734→1,738 | 238→272 | 174 |
| js-express | 546 | 393 | 0 | 65 |
| go-fzf | 1,615 | 9,991 | 0 | 131 |
| c-jq | 1,119 | 5,463 | 0 | 425 |
| cpp-spdlog | 1,357 | 1,464 | 0 | 809 |
| csharp-serilog | 1,689 | 1,864 | 0 | 663 |
| swift-alamofire | 2,538 | 6,437 | 0 | 946 |
| cpp-nlohmann-json | 5,567 | 6,738 | 0 | 2,109 |
| **TOTAL** | **19,035→19,069** | **41,184→41,188** | **238→272** | **6,751** |

Only Flask moves, and only by the entry nodes the collapse fix
un-merged. Dead-code findings are unchanged everywhere — this release
adds entry points, it does not change what counts as unreferenced.

> **These numbers are not comparable to the 0.4.1 table below.** That one

Reproduce with `scripts/perf-compare.sh` and
`scripts/framework-coverage.py`.

### Framework detection

The corpus went from 38 to **43 of 45 frameworks enumerating entry
points**. The two that remain are architectural limits cgg already
declares — not misses, and not silent.

> **Two counting bugs are disclosed below.** Both overstated or
> understated what cgg found, in the one table a reader consults to size
> an attack surface. Neither was caught by a fixture — both needed a real
> application.

#### One application per framework

`scripts/benchmark.sh` gains an `APPS=( … )` corpus: 35 applications that
*use* a framework, never the framework's own repository. A router's test
suite proves the grammar parses; it does not prove cgg recognises the
hand-off as an application writes it. Tracked two ways:

- **`scripts/docs-check.py`** — new gate, pure text, runs in pre-commit.
  Fails when a rule in `rules.rs` has no application, or an application
  claims a framework with no rule.
- **`scripts/framework-coverage.py`** (`benchmark.sh --apps`) — measures
  against the corpus and fails when a declared framework does not fire.
  Reports registrations and *distinct entry nodes* as separate columns,
  because they are not the same number and only reporting the first is
  how the collapse below stayed invisible.

The corpus, measured end to end. `registrations` is how many
hand-offs the resolver matched; `entry nodes` is how many distinct
nodes they became. The two differ when a framework carries no route
string to key a node on — see the collapse fix below.

| application | nodes | edges | entry nodes | registrations | time |

| **TOTAL** | **372,361** | **961,370** | **5,844** | **8,002** | **271.5 s** |

Two applications dominate that total: **Druid at 137 s** (92k nodes,
395k edges) and **thingsboard at 39 s**. They are the largest trees cgg
has been run against and are included deliberately — a framework corpus
that only holds small apps would not exercise the resolver at scale.
Excluding them the other 33 finish in 95 s combined.

A `~` prefix marks a framework cgg detects but cannot enumerate. It must
still appear in the coverage table's "seen, no rules" section — the
marker asserts the gap is *disclosed*, not that it is absent — and a `~`
that starts enumerating is flagged as stale.

#### Detection gaps closed

Each was a distinct real-world idiom no fixture had exercised:

| framework | what was missed | entries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `actix-actor` | **`rust.rs` never populated `base_types`** — every base-type rule was dead on Rust | 0 → 30 |
| `chi` | handlers wrapped in `chain.ToHandlerFunc(...)` | 0 → 103 |
| `sinatra` | `get "/x" do … end` — Ruby hangs the block off the call's `block` field, never the argument list | 0 → 24 |
| `worker-threads` | worker modules that identify *themselves* (`import worker_threads` + `parentPort`) rather than being named at a spawn site | 0 → 7 |
| `nestjs-schedule` | nothing — the rule was correct; the corpus app scheduled via `SchedulerRegistry` and had no `@Cron` | 0 → 5 |
| `spring-messaging` | Spring AMQP puts `@RabbitListener` on the class and `@RabbitHandler` on the *method* | 0 → 1 |

The wrapper case is worth stating precisely, because the code declined to
handle it on purpose. `collect_value_refs` skipped nested calls, reasoning
that the walker visits every call on its own turn. It does — but a
wrapper's own turn *bails*, because its verb is not a registrar verb, so
nothing captured it. Descending is therefore not the double work the
comment feared. Only the innermost callee is the handler, so the recursion
emits a call's own name only when it found nothing deeper: that is what
separates `ToHandlerFunc` from `ctrl.Handle`.

`nextjs` and `blazor` remain detected-but-not-enumerated, each with a
`gap:` string saying why: Next.js routes come from file-system layout,
and `.razor` components carry `@page` in markup cgg does not parse.

#### Fixed: entry nodes collapsed onto shared names

**A routeless entry took only the last segment of its handler's qualified
name.** Every Django view named `get` merged into one
`<framework-entry>::network::django::get` node. NetBox reported **10 entry
nodes for 150 registrations** — and the coverage table said "128 entries",
so the disclosure was honest about the framework and wrong about what
could be queried. Filtering the documented attack-surface query returned 8
nodes for ~128 endpoints, and the fan-out from each was the union of
unrelated handlers.

Now the whole qualified name. NetBox reports **281**; WordPress 604,
Mastodon 323, Ghost 272. Frameworks that carry a route string
(`@app.route("/users")`) were never affected.

#### Fixed: per-language entry counts were summed, not split

`into_coverage` keyed entry counts on `(framework, "")` — an empty
language — so a framework with a rule per language reported the
**combined** total on every row. Ghost printed
`express (network, 349 entries)` twice for one set of 349, inviting the
reader to sum it to 698. Now split correctly: **301 JavaScript + 48
TypeScript**. The coverage table also names the language whenever two rows
would otherwise be indistinguishable.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-06

A documentation audit that turned into a correctness release. Every
factual claim in `README.md` and the bundled skills was checked against
a deterministic symbolic check — `cgg` itself, `cargo test`,
`cgg --help`, `rg`, the benchmark corpus. Most claims held. The ones
that did not split into two kinds, and both kinds are fixed here: places
where the documentation described something better than the code did,
and places where the code was quietly wrong.

### Performance

0.4.0 → 0.4.1: latency **flat** (within noise).

Maintenance release. Every metric identical to 0.4.0 — latency, nodes, edges,
entry points and findings all unchanged, as intended.

| repo | latency | nodes | edges | entry | dead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 433→429 ms | 2,906 | 7,100 | 0 | 1,429 |
| python-flask | 161→157 ms | 1,460 | 1,734 | 238 | 174 |
| js-express | 103→105 ms | 285 | 393 | 0 | 65 |
| go-fzf | 287→284 ms | 1,615 | 9,991 | 0 | 131 |
| c-jq | 143→147 ms | 1,119 | 5,463 | 0 | 425 |
| cpp-spdlog | 310→325 ms | 1,357 | 1,464 | 0 | 809 |
| csharp-serilog | 143 ms | 1,689 | 1,864 | 0 | 663 |
| swift-alamofire | 422→436 ms | 2,522 | 6,437 | 0 | 946 |
| cpp-nlohmann-json | 946→937 ms | 5,567 | 6,738 | 0 | 2,109 |
| **TOTAL** | **2,948→2,963 ms** | **18,520** | **41,184** | **238** | **6,751** |

Measured across a 9-repo, 9-language comparison set. All four releases
built from source and measured together on one machine, interleaved per
repo with a discard warmup and rotated ordering. Reproduce with
`scripts/perf-compare.sh`.

**Latency noise floor is ~1.0–1.5% on the total** — two identical runs
of the same commits differ by that much, so smaller deltas are reported
as flat. Node/edge/entry/finding counts are exact and deterministic.

Zeros mean the feature did not exist in that release, not that it found
nothing. `a→b` marks a value that changed; a single value did not.

### Fixed

> **Read this section even if you skip the rest.** The first entry
> silently fabricated half of Elixir's edges. Like the `#include`
> nondeterminism fixed in 0.4.0, it produced a plausible wrong answer
> rather than an error — so nothing signalled that the graph was wrong.

- **Elixir: a definition head was recorded as a call to itself.**
  `def run(x) do … end` parses its head, `run(x)`, as a nested `call`
  node, and the walker recorded it like any other call site. Each
  phantom reference then resolved either to the function itself (a
  self-loop) or to a same-named function in another module (a bogus
  cross-file edge) — and marked its own function reachable, hiding it
  from `--dead-code`. On phoenix this was **1,404 of 2,858 edges**.
  Removing them changes no real edge: every removed edge sat exactly at
  a `def`/`defp`/`defmacro` head offset inside its own source callable,
  and no edge was added. Suppression is keyed on the head's start
  offset, so default arguments, guards, body calls and genuine
  recursion are all untouched. The benchmark row moves from 3,431 edges
  to 1,723.
- **`--max-paths` truncation was silent.** `-n 0` stopped enumerating
  at the cap and said nothing, so a capped path set was
  indistinguishable from a complete one — the caller asked for every
  route through a callable and got a prefix. Hitting the cap now prints
  a note on stderr and records a `paths_truncated` audit event. The
  event fires only when the cap actually turned away work that had been
  reached, not merely when the count landed on the limit.
- **`--dead-code` with no `-o` produced no report.** The sidecar path is
  derived from `-o`, so with the graph on stdout the report was dropped
  and only a one-line summary survived — while the documented
  invocation was `cgg ./src --dead-code`. The text report now goes to
  stderr in that case. JSON has no stderr fallback (interleaving it with
  the run summary would parse as nothing); it names the flag to pass
  instead.
- **The text report was written to a `.json` file.** The sidecar
  extension now follows `--dead-code-format`: `<output>.deadcode.txt`
  for `text`, `<output>.deadcode.json` for `json`.
- **`--write-roots` silently emitted a graph.** It lives inside the
  dead-code pass, so without `--dead-code` it fell through and printed
  ordinary mermaid — a no-op wearing the costume of a baseline. It now
  implies `--dead-code`, as `--why-live` already did.
- **`--ignore-attributes` named the wrong languages.** The "matched
  nothing" note and the `--help` text both said attribute capture was
  "python, rust" long after seven more plugins had learned it. The note
  now reads the list off the plugin registry, so it cannot rot again.
- **README self-analysis graph could not be regenerated.** It sat
  outside the `cgg:begin`/`cgg:end` markers, so the pre-commit hook
  never touched it and it had drifted to stale node ids. It is now a
  `raw:self` marker block patched on every commit.
- **The README graph generator silently dropped edges.** `clean()`
  matched edges with `" --> " in line`, which is false for cgg's own
  collapsed form `A -->|3x| B`. Every multi-site edge vanished from the
  README graphs with no error — the nodes stayed and only the arrow went
  missing. Fixed, with a `--self-test` the hook now runs.

### Changed

- **The cache feature is removed.** cgg never had an on-disk cache: the
  flags were declared in the initial commit as part of a planned task
  list and no implementation ever landed. What shipped was a hollow
  shell — `--cache DIR` and `--no-cache` parsed and were never read, an
  unused `bincode` workspace dependency, a `RESOLVER_FORMAT_VERSION`
  constant existing only to salt cache keys, a `.cgg-cache/` gitignore
  entry, and a `CacheMetrics` block emitted in **every** audit file as
  `{"hits":0,"misses":0,"bytes_read":0,"bytes_written":0}` — which reads
  as "the cache ran and got no hits", not "there is no cache". All of it
  is gone.

  The `cgg` skill had also been advising agents to leave the cache on
  because it "makes re-runs near-instant".

  **Breaking:** `--cache` and `--no-cache` are no longer accepted, so a
  command line passing either now exits 2. Unlike `--stack-graphs` and
  `--no-update-check` — kept as inert flags because they once had
  behavior a script might depend on suppressing — these never did
  anything, so nothing can depend on their effect.

  **Breaking (audit schema):** `metrics.cache` is no longer present in
  the audit document.
- `--include-tests` help text no longer claims to be "a reserved future
  knob, honored as a no-op". It has been live since 0.4.0: it widens the
  dead-code *report*, not the analysis.
- `--roots` help text now describes the discovery order it has actually
  used since 0.4.0 — analyzed paths first, then the working directory.

### Documentation

- **Three bundled skills, not two.** `skills/cgg-frameworks/SKILL.md`
  shipped in 0.4.0 and was never listed in the README;
  `install-skill.sh` had been installing it all along.
- **The audit jq recipe in the `cgg` skill did not run.** The audit
  document is a JSON array of events, so `.unresolved[]` errored with
  `Cannot index array with string`. Replaced with working queries, plus
  one that buckets unresolved sites by `reason.stage`.
- **The `cgg` skill listed six languages as lacking cross-file
  resolution that have it** (Bash, Clojure, Elixir, Erlang, Fortran,
  Julia), contradicting the README's own language table and the
  benchmark numbers. Three genuinely yield none: HCL, Verilog/SV and
  Assembly. Verilog is the subtle one — it parses `` `include ``, so it
  looks resolved, but task/function calls are never captured and so
  nothing ever crosses a file; the README table has always marked its
  cross-file column `—`, and the benchmark measures picorv32 at 0%.
- **`cgg-frameworks` contradicted itself on attribute capture**, saying
  nine languages in Step 2 and "Rust and Python only" in the limitations
  section, and pointed at `crates/cgg-core/src/frameworks_rules.rs`,
  which does not exist (it is `frameworks/rules.rs`). Its verification
  recipe also assumed the old `.deadcode.json` naming.
- Benchmark table: added the five interface/descriptor languages
  (smithy, proto, graphql, openapi, asyncapi) that had plugins and
  benchmark entries but no row, and corrected `xv6 (c+asm)` from 2,087
  to 2,092 edges. All 45 rows now reproduce exactly.
- License section enumerated seven licenses; the dependency tree
  actually uses Zlib (`foldhash`) and Unicode-3.0 (`unicode-ident`) too.
  It now points at `deny.toml` as the authority.
- Verilog's language-table row explains that `` `include `` yields no
  edges because task/function *calls* are not captured — only module
  instantiation is.
- **The `## CLI` usage synopsis never listed `--since`.** The flag
  shipped with a table row and its own worked example, but the usage
  block above them was never updated. `docs-check.py` had only ever
  validated the flag *table*, so nothing noticed.
- **The license section pointed at the wrong artifact.** It claimed
  `MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR LGPL-2.1-or-later` was "the only copyleft
  identifier anywhere in `Cargo.lock`" — but lockfiles record no license
  fields at all, so that check could never have run. The claim itself
  holds (`r-efi` is the sole crate offering an LGPL disjunct across all
  176 packages); it now names the dependency tree, which is where the
  evidence actually lives.
- `docs-check.py` grew a sixth check so the synopsis cannot drift again:
  every flag in `cgg --help` that still does something must appear in
  the usage block, and a flag named there that no longer exists fails
  the commit. Deprecated no-ops (`--stack-graphs`, `--no-update-check`)
  are exempt — they identify themselves with "No effect" in their help
  text, and the synopsis is the wrong place to advertise a flag that
  does nothing.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-06

Two features that ask opposite questions of the same graph.

**Dead-code reporting** asks what nothing calls. **Framework entry
points** answer why so much of the apparent answer was wrong: cgg
resolves calls it can see in source, and frameworks invoke user code by
means that are not calls. A route handler rendered as a node with
in-degree zero — which is not merely an incomplete graph but a false
claim that nothing calls it, and which then cascaded into a dead-code
finding for the handler *and* for every private helper reachable only
from it.

They ship together because neither is honest without the other. Both are
**best effort by construction**, both state their evidence, and both say
plainly what they could not see.

**Also fixes a correctness bug that silently affected every C/C++ graph
cgg has ever produced** — `#include` resolution was nondeterministic, so
C/C++ edge counts varied run to run. See *Fixed* below.

### Performance 0.4.0

0.3.0 → 0.4.0: latency **flat** (within noise).

**+2,159 edges (+5.5%) with no node change and no latency cost.** Five
repos moved, for three distinct reasons:

- **ripgrep +1,520** — Rust macro-argument call extraction. Calls inside
  `format!`/`writeln!`/`vec!` produced no edge at all before, because
  tree-sitter leaves macro bodies as unstructured token trees.
- **flask +440, express +180, alamofire +24** — of flask's gain, 238 are
  the entry-node edges themselves; the rest is new extraction reaching
  call sites it previously missed.
- **spdlog: a range replaced by a value.** The table shows 1,469 → 1,464,
  but that −5 is not a decrease — 0.3.0 has no stable edge count on this
  repo. Ten runs of the *same* 0.3.0 binary on the *same* input give
  1460 ×3, 1463 ×4, 1466 ×1, 1469 ×2; the collection run simply drew
  1,469. Ten runs of 0.4.0 give 1464 every time. `collect_include_defs`
  resolved each `#include` by taking the first `HashMap` iteration
  match, and Rust reseeds its hasher per process, so when several files
  matched an include suffix — routine in C/C++, where many directories
  carry their own `common.h` — the winner varied per run and a different
  header meant a different set of imported definitions. 0.4.0 prefers
  the exactly-resolved path, then the lowest `FileId`.

  This is also why the 0.2.0 and 0.3.0 totals in these tables are ±6
  edges run-to-run, and why their spdlog rows should be read as
  "1460–1469", not as the single number shown.

Entry points and dead-code reporting appear here for the first time.
Entry nodes are ON by default, so this is new default work absorbed at
no measurable latency cost, offset by removing the inert stack-graphs
orchestration.

| repo | latency | nodes | edges | entry | dead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 442→433 ms | 2,906 | 5,580→7,100 | 0 | 0→1,429 |
| python-flask | 137→161 ms | 1,460 | 1,294→1,734 | 0→238 | 0→174 |
| js-express | 101→103 ms | 285 | 213→393 | 0 | 0→65 |
| go-fzf | 315→287 ms | 1,615 | 9,991 | 0 | 0→131 |
| c-jq | 177→143 ms | 1,119 | 5,463 | 0 | 0→425 |
| cpp-spdlog | 307→310 ms | 1,357 | 1,469→1,464 | 0 | 0→809 |
| csharp-serilog | 142→143 ms | 1,689 | 1,864 | 0 | 0→663 |
| swift-alamofire | 450→422 ms | 2,522 | 6,413→6,437 | 0 | 0→946 |
| cpp-nlohmann-json | 932→946 ms | 5,567 | 6,738 | 0 | 0→2,109 |
| **TOTAL** | **3,003→2,948 ms** | **18,520** | **39,025→41,184** | **0→238** | **0→6,751** |

Measured across a 9-repo, 9-language comparison set. All four releases
built from source and measured together on one machine, interleaved per
repo with a discard warmup and rotated ordering. Reproduce with
`scripts/perf-compare.sh`.

**Latency noise floor is ~1.0–1.5% on the total** — two identical runs
of the same commits differ by that much, so smaller deltas are reported
as flat. Node/edge/entry/finding counts are exact and deterministic.

Zeros mean the feature did not exist in that release, not that it found
nothing. `a→b` marks a value that changed; a single value did not.

### Dead-code reporting

cgg already computed the thing a dead-code finder
needs — a resolved call graph — but had no way to ask "what does nothing
call?". `--dead-code` answers that, annotating the normal graph output
rather than replacing it.

The report is **best effort by construction**: cgg reports what it could
not find a caller for, which is not the same as proving no caller
exists. Every output surface says so, every finding carries the evidence
both for and against it, and `--why-live` inverts the question so the
reasoning can be checked in the opposite direction. cgg never modifies
code and takes no position on what should be done about a finding.

#### Added

- **`--dead-code`.** Marks callables nothing appears to reference as
  `unreferenced` in whatever `-t` selects — mermaid label + `classDef`,
  dot dashed node + tooltip, a graphml `<data>` key, a json field. The
  detailed report (evidence, roots, per-language capability table) goes
  to a `<output>.deadcode.json` sidecar, the same convention the audit
  already used.
- **`--why-live PATTERN`.** Prints the shortest path from a root proving
  a callable is live, preferring high-confidence direct edges and
  non-test roots. Answers "why do you think this is used?" and, when no
  path exists, says so as a derivation rather than an assertion.
- **`cgg-deadcode.toml`.** `roots` entries are entry points and confer
  liveness transitively; `[[allow]]` entries are reviewed findings that
  are suppressed *without* being made live, so accepting one hides it
  and nothing else. Parsed with `deny_unknown_fields`, so a typo is a
  hard error rather than a silently ignored line. `--write-roots`
  generates a baseline; `--roots FILE` pins it.
- **Supporting flags:** `--dead-code-format`, `--dead-code-confidence`,
  `--dead-code-report`, `--ignore-names`, `--ignore-attributes`,
  `--fail-on-dead` (exit 3, opt-in).
- **Calls inside Rust macro arguments are now extracted.** tree-sitter
  leaves macro bodies as unstructured token trees, so a real call like
  `writeln!(out, "{}", xml_escape(s))` produced no edge. Rust edge
  counts rise ~12-27% depending on macro density; no other language is
  affected.
- **New extraction signals:** normalized `Vis` for 7 languages (was 2),
  `TestRole` and test-file classification, `ExportRecord` (Rust
  `pub use`, Python `__all__`), `DynUse` reflection hints
  (suppression-only, never an edge), and `UnreachableRegion` for
  statements after an unconditional terminator across 6 language
  families.
- **`LanguagePlugin::signals()`** — a per-plugin manifest of which
  optional signals it actually extracts, so a report can distinguish
  "this definition genuinely has no attributes" from "cgg never looked".

#### Removed

- **The update check, and with it every network call cgg makes.**
  `update_check.rs` made one `GET` to `api.github.com` per day to read a
  release tag. Its dependency, `minreq`, carried the entire HTTP/TLS
  stack — `rustls`, `rustls-webpki`, `webpki-roots` — and with it three
  RustSec advisories (RUSTSEC-2026-0098/0099/0104).

  Clearing those advisories in place meant `minreq` 2 → 3, which pulls
  `aws-lc-rs`/`aws-lc-sys` and a build-time C toolchain — a poor trade
  for a feature whole exploit surface was "someone lies to you about the
  latest version number". Removing the feature clears them outright and
  makes *offline* a property of the code rather than a default that can
  be flipped: the workspace now contains zero network call sites.

  `--no-update-check` is still accepted and does nothing, so existing
  command lines keep working. To keep an installed binary current, use
  `cargo install-update -a` (from the `cargo-update` crate) or re-run
  `cargo install --git`.

### Framework entry points

cgg resolves calls it can see in source; frameworks invoke user code by
means that are not calls. That did not merely leave the graph
incomplete — it made it **wrong**: a route handler rendered as a node
with in-degree zero, which is a claim ("nothing calls this") and a false
one.

`<framework-entry>` nodes fix that, mirroring the exit nodes
`--include-external` already minted for control leaving the tree. They
are **on by default**, deliberately unlike the exit-node flags: an exit
node tells you nothing you did not already know from reading the call,
while an entry node tells you something the source cannot state at all.

Entry nodes are an **inference, not an observation** — nothing in your
source says the call happens — so coverage is disclosed rather than
implied. Every run prints which frameworks were recognised, which were
seen and not understood, and which languages have no rules at all.

#### Added

- **`<framework-entry>` nodes.** One per entry point with real identity
  — a route, a queue, a command — carrying a trust-boundary kind in the
  qualified name (`<framework-entry>::network::flask::route("/users")`).
  Edges are `Via::FrameworkEntry(framework)` at `Confidence::Low`,
  tagged `entry` in mermaid, bold purple in dot, and `framework-entry`
  in a new graphml edge attribute.
- **Trust-boundary kinds** — `network`, `queue`, `schedule`, `cli`,
  `ffi`, `lifecycle`, `test` — filterable because they are part of the
  name: `cgg ./src --filter '<framework-entry>::network::' -n 3`
  enumerates attack surface and its blast radius in one query. Only
  `network` is asserted to carry untrusted input; `queue` depends on who
  can enqueue, which cgg cannot see.
- **Framework rules for 40+ frameworks** across python, javascript,
  typescript, java, kotlin, go, ruby, php, csharp, rust and cpp,
  covering all six hand-off shapes: attribute markers (Flask, FastAPI,
  Spring, Jakarta/Quarkus, Micronaut, NestJS, ASP.NET MVC, Symfony,
  Rocket, Actix, Celery, Click), value refs (Express, Gin, Echo, Fiber,
  Chi, net/http, Axum, Django `urls.py`, Temporal), inline closures,
  base types (PyTorch, Quartz, MassTransit, Sidekiq, Akka,
  `BackgroundService`, `Runnable`), string targets (Rails
  `'photos#index'`, Laravel's `@` string *and* `[C::class,'m']` array,
  WordPress hooks) and module paths (`worker_threads`, piscina).
- **A coverage table on every run.** Three sections, stated separately:
  what was recognised (with entry counts), what was *seen and not
  enumerated* (with the reason), and which languages have no rules.
  A framework that is recognised but matched nothing is reported as a
  gap too, because "flask (network, 0 entries)" reads as "this app has
  no routes". Also emitted as an `AuditEvent::FrameworkCoverage`, with
  `FRAMEWORK_ENTRY_DISCLAIMER` copied in by the engine so no formatter
  can drop it.
- **`[[framework]]` blocks in `cgg-deadcode.toml`,** so the gap list is
  actionable: a framework cgg does not ship rules for can be covered
  locally without waiting for a release.
- **`--no-entry-nodes`** to opt out, and **`--framework-coverage`** to
  print the table even when nothing was recognised.
- **CUDA kernels are entry points.** `tree-sitter-cpp` parses
  `saxpy<<<a,b>>>(x)` as nested comparison operators, so the launch
  produces no edge and the kernel plus every `__device__` helper read as
  dead. Treating `__global__` as a root qualifier fixes the cascade
  without fighting the grammar.

#### Extraction

- **Attribute capture** for java, csharp, typescript, javascript, php,
  kotlin and cpp (previously rust and python only). Stored **verbatim**,
  because `python.rs` refines a `DefVariant` from raw decorator text and
  `--ignore-attributes` matches what the user actually wrote. This also
  raises those languages' dead-code confidence ceiling.
- **Value-reference capture** for python, javascript, typescript, go,
  java, csharp, php and ruby (previously rust only), with two long-
  standing gaps closed: `intra_file` could only bind a value ref within
  one file, and a value ref resolved across files was tagged
  `Via::Direct` — claiming a call site that does not exist and escaping
  the `--reference-edges` flag meant to gate it.
- **Base-type capture** (`DefRecord::base_types`) for python, java,
  csharp, javascript, typescript, php and ruby, including Ruby's
  `include Sidekiq::Job` mixins. This is the principled replacement for
  the hardcoded `LIFECYCLE` name list.
- **PHP import capture** (`use`/`namespace`) and **PHP static calls**
  (`C::m()`), neither of which was extracted before. PHP's graph on the
  Laravel corpus goes from **329 edges to 16,355** (0 → 15,408
  cross-file); the run costs ~70% more wall time as a result, which is
  the price of a language whose call graph was previously ~1% resolved.
- **TypeScript signal manifest.** `TypeScriptPlugin` reused `JsWalker`
  but declared no signals and skipped the unreachable/reflection passes,
  so the dead-code capability table said cgg had never looked. Both
  fixed.
- `RefRecord` gains `context` and `route`; `DefRecord` gains
  `base_types`; `CallableNode` gains `framework_entry`. All additive and
  serde-defaulted.

#### Verified against real applications

Seven applications *using* each framework — not the frameworks' own
repositories, which never import themselves and exercise no rule:

| app | framework | entries found |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NetBox | Django | 128 network · 22 cli |
| Netflix Dispatch | FastAPI | 318 network · 38 cli |
| Mastodon | Rails + Sidekiq | 199 network · 109 queue |
| macrozheng/mall | Spring Boot | 250 network · 1 schedule |
| PhotoPrism | Gin + Chi | 44 network |
| crates.io | Axum | 70 network |
| Ultralytics | PyTorch | 159 lifecycle (root-marked, no nodes) |

Both payoffs move in the right direction on those applications, which
is the test a phase has to pass to earn its place — entry nodes up,
dead-code findings down:

| app | findings without entry nodes | with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ultralytics | 1,400 | 1,169 (−17%) |
| Netflix Dispatch | 2,564 | 2,133 (−17%) |

That exercise found five defects that fixtures had not:

- **A UTF-8 panic aborted the entire run.** `detect.rs` sliced a file's
  head at byte 2048 without checking the char boundary, so any file
  whose first 2 KiB contain non-Latin text crashed the process. Mastodon
  ships ~90 such translation catalogues. `type_hints.rs` had the same
  bug on `ty[..1]` for a non-ASCII identifier.
- **Rust value refs lost their route.** The registration context was
  emitted as a *second* record sharing the first's `(name, site_byte)`,
  and the context-less one won — so every axum route resolved anonymous.
- **Ambiguous verbs matched ordinary code.** `crate_ids.get(id)` and
  `session.get("user_id")` became "routes" in an axum project. A match on
  a verb like `get`/`add`/`use` now needs corroboration: an identity, or
  a receiver-less call (axum's `get(handler)` is a free function; a map
  lookup is not).
- **String routing applied everywhere.** Decoding a string into a
  handler name is now opt-in per rule (`string_targets`), set only for
  the four frameworks that route that way.
- **A marker-only rule detected everywhere.** CUDA has no import to gate
  on, so it counted as "detected" in every repository containing a C++
  file and was reported as a coverage gap in all of them.

Three coverage gaps closed as a direct result:

- **Inherited framework contracts.** A real application never inherits
  the framework base directly — NetBox writes `class
  CircuitListView(generic.ObjectListView)` and only three levels up does
  anything name Django's `View`. Base-type matching now walks the
  inheritance chain (depth-capped, cycle-guarded): Django 65 → 128
  entries, PyTorch 143 → 159, Sidekiq 96 → 109.
- **`utoipa::path`.** The `utoipa-axum` pattern registers handlers
  through `.routes(routes!(a, b, c))`, a proc-macro whose token tree
  cgg cannot read — but every one of those handlers carries its method
  and path in a `#[utoipa::path]` attribute. crates.io went 7 → 70.
- **Sidekiq workers carry no import.** Rails autoloads, so
  `app/workers/*.rb` names `Sidekiq::Worker` without requiring it; the
  convention directory is the only marker. Mastodon 0 → 109.

**`#include` resolution was nondeterministic — this silently affected
every C/C++ graph cgg has ever produced.** `collect_include_defs` picked
its target with `HashMap::values().find(...)`, and Rust seeds its hasher
per process, so when several files matched an include suffix — routine
in C/C++, where many directories carry their own `common.h` — the winner
varied run to run, and a different header meant a different set of
imported definitions.

Measured on `cpp-spdlog`: the same binary on the same input produced
1460 ×3, 1463 ×4, 1466 ×1, 1469 ×2 across ten runs. It now prefers the
exactly-resolved path, then the lowest `FileId`, and gives 1464 every
time.

Consequences worth knowing:

- Any C/C++ edge count published before 0.4.0 — including this
  project's own README benchmark table — was one draw from a range, not
  a fixed value.
- Determinism is a headline claim in the README. It did not hold for
  C/C++, and no test covered it. `dead_code_output_is_byte_stable` and
  the `edge_order_invariance` unit tests now do.
- The bug predates 0.3.0; it is fixed here rather than in a patch
  release because it was found while building the dead-code engine,
  whose whole model assumes a stable graph.

- **Invalid `--filter` / `--exclude-*` patterns are now a hard error.**
  A bad regex was silently mapped to match-everything, while
  `apply_exclusions` silently dropped it — two opposite silent failures
  for the same mistake.
- **Config discovery was working-directory-relative,** so
  `cgg /path/to/project` from anywhere else silently ignored that
  project's `cgg-deadcode.toml`. Discovery now searches upward from each
  analyzed path first.
- **`cross_file` de-duplicated edges with an O(edges) scan per resolved
  reference.** Invisible while PHP resolved almost nothing; ~4s of a
  Laravel run once it started resolving properly. Now indexed.
- GraphML dropped the edge `via` tag entirely, so a consumer could not
  tell an inferred edge from a resolved call.
- **Haskell definitions were never qualified by their module.**
  `extract_module` looked for a `module_name` node that
  `tree-sitter-haskell` 0.23 does not have (the kind is `module`, and
  the keyword is an anonymous token of the same name), so every Haskell
  callable came out as a bare `work` rather than `Data.Thing.work` and
  same-named functions in different modules were indistinguishable.
  Silent, because an unqualified name is still a perfectly good name.
  Haskell now joins with `.`, matching how modules are written and
  imported; on pandoc this resolves ~250 previously-unresolved calls.

### Changed

- **`--stack-graphs` has no effect** and its help text now says so. The
  integration was removed in the tree-sitter 0.26 upgrade (upstream
  pins tree-sitter 0.24); the orchestration around the resulting stub
  still ran on every invocation, deep-copying the graph, the facts and
  every file's source bytes into a thread before blocking on a
  60-second timeout. Removing it, and the retained source-byte corpus
  it kept alive, made ordinary runs measurably faster.
- Dead-code-only extraction is gated behind the mode, so a run without
  `--dead-code` does not pay for it.

### Compatibility

Default output is unchanged except for the two edge-count effects noted
above (Rust macro-argument calls, C/C++ `#include` determinism), both of
which only ever *add* or *stabilise* edges. `--stack-graphs` is still
accepted. `--include-tests`, previously parsed and never read, now has
real semantics.

**The default graph grows.** Entry nodes are on by default, so node and
edge counts move for every language with framework rules. This follows
the project's standing rule that the default graph only ever grows in
default mode; `--no-entry-nodes` restores the previous shape exactly.

Adding `Via::FrameworkEntry` is a compile error in exactly the two
`match` arms that classify edges for output, so no formatter can
silently ignore it.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

Five interface/descriptor languages, taking cgg from 39 to **44**
languages. These map an API model's shape graph onto the call-graph
model, so a descriptor renders as a topology of
service → operation → message/structure → field-type edges. Purely
additive: no existing language's graph changes.

### Performance

0.2.0 → 0.3.0: latency **flat** (within noise).

Five interface/descriptor languages added. Graph unchanged on this set (+3
edges) because those languages are not present in it.

| repo | latency | nodes | edges | entry | dead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| rust-ripgrep | 432→442 ms | 2,906 | 5,580 | 0 | 0 |

| cpp-nlohmann-json | 934→932 ms | 5,567 | 6,738 | 0 | 0 |
| **TOTAL** | **3,006→3,003 ms** | **18,520** | **39,019→39,025** | **0** | **0** |

**Caveat on this table:** cgg's `#include` resolution is nondeterministic
in this release (fixed in 0.4.0). `cpp-spdlog`'s edge count varies
1460–1469 across runs of this same binary, so its row — and the totals —
are one draw from a range, not a fixed value.

Measured across a 9-repo, 9-language comparison set. All four releases
built from source and measured together on one machine, interleaved per
repo with a discard warmup and rotated ordering. Reproduce with
`scripts/perf-compare.sh`.

**Latency noise floor is ~1.0–1.5% on the total** — two identical runs
of the same commits differ by that much, so smaller deltas are reported
as flat. Node/edge/entry/finding counts are exact and deterministic.

Zeros mean the feature did not exist in that release, not that it found
nothing. `a→b` marks a value that changed; a single value did not.

### Added

- **Smithy, Protobuf, GraphQL, OpenAPI/Swagger, and AsyncAPI plugins.**
  - Smithy: `service → operation → structure → shape-member` edges;
    traits and prelude primitives skipped. The published
    `tree-sitter-smithy` crate pins an incompatible `tree-sitter 0.20`,
    so its generated `parser.c` is **vendored** under
    `crates/cgg-lang/vendor/smithy/` (MIT, see `PROVENANCE.md`),
    compiled by a new `crates/cgg-lang/build.rs`, and bound through
    `tree_sitter_language::LanguageFn`.
  - Protobuf: message field types + gRPC `service` rpc →
    request/response message edges.
  - GraphQL: SDL `type → field-type`, `implements`, and `union` member
    edges; built-in scalars skipped.
  - OpenAPI/Swagger and AsyncAPI: YAML **or** JSON (both parsed with the
    YAML grammar), content-detected by their root `openapi:` /
    `swagger:` / `asyncapi:` key via a new `cgg-lang::detect` rule, so
    ordinary `.yaml`/`.json` config/data files are untouched.
    Operation → schema and schema → schema (`$ref`) edges; AsyncAPI adds
    channel/message edges.
- **Cross-file resolution for descriptor languages.** References in
  Smithy/Protobuf/GraphQL/OpenAPI/AsyncAPI resolve by global simple-name
  within the model (bounded to ≤4 candidates) — see
  `cgg-resolve::cross_file`.

### Changed / Improved

- **Per-language stdlib filter audit.** 21 stdlib lists (bash, c, cpp,
  clojure, dart, elixir, erlang, go, groovy, haskell, hcl, javascript,
  kotlin, lua, objc, perl, php, python, ruby, typescript, zig) tuned
  against real-world `external`-bucket noise. Eight remain seeded from
  language references only (csharp, fortran, java, julia, ocaml, r,
  scala, swift).
- Docs synced to the code: README language table/count (44), embedded
  mermaid graphs, self-stats, and the Limitations / Potential-future-
  improvements sections; `skills/cgg/SKILL.md`; `CLAUDE.md`; and the
  `scripts/benchmark.sh` targets for the five new languages.

### Compatibility / migration

- **To keep the previous behavior: do nothing.** The five new languages
  only add graphs for file types that previously produced none. No
  existing language's nodes or edges change. `.yaml`/`.json` files are
  analyzed only when their root key marks them as an OpenAPI/AsyncAPI
  document.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-18

A resolver-precision pass (the `necessary_fixes.md` program) plus four
opt-in output modes. Verified against a 38-language real-world corpus:
**the default graph is a strict superset of the previous one — 0 nodes
and 0 edges lost in any language** (checked at per-call-site,
overload-distinguishing granularity), and faster.

### Performance

Baseline for the series; 0.1.0 predates this CHANGELOG and was not
measured. Dead-code reporting and framework entry points did not exist.

| repo | latency | nodes | edges | entry | dead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

nothing. `a→b` marks a value that changed; a single value did not.

### Added

- **Update check.** A best-effort, **opt-out**, once-a-day "newer
  release available?" notice. It runs on a background thread that
  overlaps the analysis, prints a single line to stderr only in an
  interactive terminal, and caches its result in
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cgg/update-check.json` (so the network is hit at most
  once per 24h). It is cgg's *only* network access, never affects the
  graph/output/exit-code, and is disabled by `--no-update-check`,
  `--quiet`, a non-interactive invocation, or `CGG_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` /
  `DO_NOT_TRACK` / `CI`. (Adds cgg's first network dependency, `minreq`
  - rustls — binary stays self-contained, no system OpenSSL.)
- **`--include-external` / `--include-stdlib`** — surface calls into
  third-party / standard-library code as deduplicated leaf "exit nodes"
  (one node per `(language, receiver, name)` symbol; every call site
  collapses onto it with multiplicity). Edges tagged `ext` / `std`.
- **`--dynamic-dispatch`** — for interface/trait dispatch, emit fan-out
  edges from each method *declaration* to every concrete *implementation*
  (one low-confidence edge per impl). The exact call-site → declaration
  edge is always emitted; this flag adds the over-approximated dispatch.
  Edges tagged `dyn`. (Plugin capture wired for Rust; resolver/format
  machinery is language-agnostic.)
- **`--reference-edges`** — when a function is passed *by name* as a
  value (`register(handler)`), emit a reference edge distinct from a
  call edge, repairing the "registered handler looks like dead code"
  distortion. Edges tagged `ref`. (Rust.)
- New `Via` edge kinds (`External`, `Stdlib`, `Reference`) and
  `CallableNode` fields (`synthetic`, `trait_impl_target`), rendered as
  label tags in mermaid (`ext`/`std`/`dyn`/`ref`), edge styles in dot,
  and serialized in json/graphml.
- **Structured unresolved-call audit** — each unresolved record now
  names the resolution *stage* that rejected it
  (`no-candidate-in-file`, `ambiguous-in-file`, `no-candidate-cross-file`,
  …) plus the evidence it had (candidate counts, which name-screen was
  applied). The unresolved population is now sliceable by category for
  regression tracking.

### Changed / Improved (default mode — no flags needed)

- **Toolchain.** Moved to the Rust **2024 edition**; minimum supported
  Rust is now **1.85** (was 1.80). No API changes — a one-line
  match-ergonomics adjustment was the only code impact.
- **Cache format.** `RESOLVER_FORMAT_VERSION` bumped to `2` so stale
  `.cgg-cache` entries from 0.1.x are re-extracted (the new
  function-as-value records and edge kinds need a fresh pass).
- **Owner-qualified disambiguation.** Same-name candidates
  (`Parser::new` vs `Cursor::new`, and `Self::new` inside an impl) are
  now disambiguated by the call's owner qualifier instead of being
  abandoned as ambiguous.
- **Cross-file receiver resolution.** Method calls on a receiver of
  known type now resolve through an `(owner type, method)` index —
  including through import aliases (`use a::b::Engine as Motor`) and
  multi-segment receiver paths. This also made resolution **faster**:
  the index replaces a per-call-site O(callables) scan with an O(1)
  lookup (≈ −40% wall time on method-heavy Kotlin, −33% on Rust).
- **Standard-library name-collision ordering.** A project method whose
  name collides with stdlib vocabulary (`EntityId::len`) is no longer
  siphoned into the stdlib bucket — owner ownership is checked first.

### Fixed

- The summary line's `cross-file` count used a formula that predated
  edge deduplication; it now counts actual inter-file edges of the whole
  analysis and stays consistent with the `edges` total even under
  `--filter`/`-n`.
- A latent subtract-overflow panic in the summary computation
  (surfaced by the new synthetic edges).

### Compatibility / migration

- **To keep the previous behavior: do nothing.** All new behavior is
  either a strictly-additive precision improvement or gated behind an
  opt-in flag. With no new flags, the default graph contains every node
  and edge the previous version produced (verified across 38 languages),
  plus newly-resolved direct edges — nothing is removed or retargeted at
  the unique-edge level.
- **To get the new structural views:** add the opt-in flags above. They
  only *add* tagged edges/nodes. Downstream consumers can include or
  exclude them by the mermaid label tags (`ext`/`std`/`dyn`/`ref`) or by
  the `via` / `confidence` fields in json/graphml.
- **Audit consumers:** the unresolved `reason` field is now a structured
  object (`{"stage": …}`); the deserializer still accepts the old
  free-form string, so existing tooling that only reads other fields is
  unaffected.
