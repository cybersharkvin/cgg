//! Intermediate facts produced by the per-file extraction pass.
//!
//! Each language plugin walks its tree-sitter AST once and emits a
//! [`FileFacts`] value describing the callables defined in the file
//! and the call sites referencing other callables. Every later stage —
//! the intra-file linker, the scope-aware cross-file resolvers, the FFI
//! linker — consumes this same shape.
//!
//! The shape follows codescope's "definition vs reference" split but
//! is strongly typed, carries fully-qualified names from day one, and
//! tracks byte ranges alongside line ranges (byte ranges are what
//! tree-sitter speaks natively and the intra-file linker needs for
//! smallest-enclosing-range containment).
